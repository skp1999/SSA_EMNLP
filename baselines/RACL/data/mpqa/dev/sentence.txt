[ " Opinion " : " Independence of UNCHR impugned by biased reports " ]
The United Nations human rights rapporteur , Maurice Copithorne , on Friday once again repeated his stereotyped allegations against the Islamic Republic by expressing concern over what he called human rights violations in Iran .
Copithorne , who has served in the UN post since 1995 , through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights ( UNCHR ) , whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18 , has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington 's biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic .
The UN rapporteur 's new report on Iran , which he submitted to the commission on Friday , includes nothing new .
In most cases he described the legal punishments like floggings and executions of murderers and major drug traffickers that are applied based on the Shria , or Islamic law as human rights violations .
In other cases , he made unfounded charges by accusing Iran of discrimination against women and minorities .
He made such charges despite the fact that women 's political , social and cultural participation is not less than that of men .
Women in Iran hold managerial , academic and parliamentary posts and even have positions in the government and the cabinet .
And as far as minorities are concerned , they enjoy rights equal to those of the Muslim majority , as they have their own representatives in Parliament and practice their religion quite freely .
In his report , the UN human rights rapporteur also interfered in Iran 's internal affairs .
For instance , he denounced as a human rights violation the banning and seizure of satellite dishes in Iran , while the measure has been taken in line with the law .
He also tried to portray a false image of the Judiciary and its officials and went so far as to accuse the Judiciary officials of human rights violations !
This spiteful attitude clearly shows that Copithorne is only a hireling tasked with tarnishing the image of the Islamic Republic and its senior officials .
Interestingly , although Copithorne has not visited Iran since 1996 , he continues to submit his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights without having any knowledge of the realities in the Islamic Republic .
This means that his annual anti-Iran reports are only dictated to him by Zionist circles and arrogant powers like the United States that lost their illegitimate interests in Iran with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and downfall of their puppet Pahlavi regime .
Publishing such biased reports will only create mistrust among nations regarding the objectives and independence of the UN Commission on Human Rights .
2 observer groups funded by EU
Herald Reporter - TWO observer groups that have been critical of the just ended presidential election were funded by the European Union , it has been learnt .
Diplomatic sources yesterday said the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) Parliamentary Forum observer mission and the Zimbabwe Election Support Network ( ZESN ) were funded by the EU , which was kicked out of Zimbabwe and denied the opportunity to observe the election .
The two groups have criticised the election process with the Sadc Parliamentary Forum saying it did not meet the regional grouping 's standards on elections .
But the Sadc Ministerial Task Force said the election was free and fair .
The foreign-funded local NGO , ZESN , described the poll as chaotic .
According to the sources , the EU which was barred by the Government from observing the election because some of its members were openly supporting the MDC , sent a Ms Maria Macchiaverna to " support the financial management of our assistance " to the Sadc Parliamentary Forum and ZESN .
The sources said the EU advised the Government of the arrival of the official in a letter dated March 8 , seeking assistance for her to be cleared by immigration authorities .
" This explains why the two groups were critical of the election .
They were paid and asked to paint a bad picture and they have done it .
It is easy to paint a bad picture because one can do it even with eyes closed since one would have been paid to do so , " the sources said .
Despite these negative reports , most observer groups have declared the election free and fair .
The Sadc ministerial observer team yesterday congratulated President Mugabe on his victory .
The team met President Mugabe at Zimbabwe House where it briefed him of its opinion that the presidential election was substantially free and fair , despite a view to the contrary by the West .
Speaking on behalf of the team , Angolan Deputy Information and Social Services Minister Mr Manuel Augusto said Africa was best qualified to judge the poll because some Western countries had prejudged the outcome .
" I do n't know of any Sadc country that two months ago already said that X or Y would win the election but we know countries that two months ago predicted the result of the election .
" The Europeans have their own views on Africa and we have our own on Africa .
We will leave Zimbabwe with a sense of accomplishment after observing the election , " he told reporters after meeting Cde Mugabe .
He added : " We came to witness the election , to observe .
We did n't come to vote and the results of the election were the true will of the Zimbabwean people .
We saw the same thing but with different views which is normal . "
The Tanzanian and Democratic Republic of Congo observer teams also met President Mugabe to congratulate him on his victory and said the election had been free and fair .
US begins flying Afghan prisoners to Cuba
WASHINGTON : The US military on Thursday began flying al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners under heavy guard from Afghanistan to jail at the American Navy base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , a military spokesman said .
An Air Force C-17 cargo plane with 20 of at least 371 " detainees " being held in Afghanistan departed Kandahar air base at about 11 am EST ( 1600 GMT ) , Marine Corps Maj. Brad Lowell , a spokesman for the US Central Command in Tampa , Florida , said .
" There were 20 " on the plane , Lowell said .
He declined to say when the first prisoners might arrive at facilities surrounded by razor wire at the US Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay .
US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters that major security precautions were being taken in moving the prisoners , including hard-line , anti-Western followers of fugitive guerrilla leader Osama Bin Laden .
Lowell said some small-arms fire was directed at US troops on the Kandahar base after the aircraft took off in the early evening Afghanistan time , but that the C-17 was not fired upon .
No injuries were reported as a result of the gunfire , which came from outside the base , he added .
" The aircraft had departed earlier when the Marines at the operating base received fire .
At no time was that aircraft in any danger .
It did not perform any evasive maneuvers , " Lowell said .
Marines dealing with Kandahar threat : " The Marines there are in the process of dealing with that threat .
Our initial reports have no injuries . "
A US Marine spokesman in Kandahar told CNN late on Thursday that the gunfire came from snipers that penetrated the outer perimeter of the base and was not believed to be linked to the transfer of prisoners .
" These were two isolated incidents , in that the detainee movement was something that we did not get official notification that we were going to do until this morning , " Lt. James Jarvis said .
" I do n't believe that it is going to affect our transfer of detainees because , quite simply , we have adequate security for that . "
In Washington , US defense officials earlier said that unprecedented security -- including chains and possibly sedation and hoods -- might be used in transporting the prisoners , who include members of Bin Laden 's al-Qaeda guerrilla network .
One of the officials , who asked not to be identified , said that planning called for the prisoners , not yet charged with crimes , to be manacled together and outnumbered by specially trained guards carrying incapacitating stun guns .
Others confirmed a report in USA Today that consideration was being given to tranquilizing some of the detainees and perhaps even covering their heads with hoods for flights that would take more than 12 hours .
The human rights advocacy group Amnesty International expressed concern about reports that the prisoners " may be drugged , hooded and shackled , " saying that they must be treated with full respect for international standards .
" If restraints are necessary , they must be applied humanely , with adequate opportunity for the prisoner to move limbs , use the bathroom and eat and drink , " the group said in a statement .
Rumsfeld told reporters on Thursday that every effort would be made to secure hardline prisoners , many considered dangerous and possibly suicidal followers of Bin Laden .
The al-Qaeda leaders is accused by Washington of masterminding the September 11 suicide aircraft attacks on New York and Washington .
" They ( military officials ) have been authorized and instructed to use appropriate restraints .
They are fully aware that these are dangerous individuals , " he said during a press conference with Australian Defence Minister Robert Hill .
'Willing to kill themselves , others ' : " There are among these prisoners people who are perfectly willing to kill themselves and kill other people , " Rumsfeld added .
He provided no details except to say that the Pentagon had consulted experts on prisons and prisoners .
The US military has so far taken control of more than 300 prisoners at a base in Kandahar and others at Bagram air base near Kabul , at Mazar-i-Sharif and aboard the Navy helicopter assault ship USS Bataan in the northern Indian Ocean .
The Pentagon refused to discuss details of the transfer , and Defence Department spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said on Thursday that no announcements would be made until the first detainees arrived at the secluded base , where a high-security , barbed wire-enclosed facility is being built .
" What we have done all along is ( said ) that they are being treated humanely in accordance with the Geneva Convention , " Clarke told reporters .
The convention sets out the rights and responsibilities of war prisoners and their guards .
Hundreds of US military police and Marine Corps reinforcements have been flown to the " Gitmo " base , as it is called , in Cuba and prisoners will be held inside a compound ringed by two fences topped with razor wire .
For most of the day they will be held in small cells with a concrete floor and chain-link walls , with spotlights on at night .
It was not known if American John Walker , captured fighting with Bin Laden 's now vanquished protectors the Taliban , would be among those brought to Guantanamo .
The Defence Department has not announced any decision on how many of the detainees will be transferred or how many , if any , might face military courts martial authorized by President George W Bush in the wake of the September attacks .
Under close scrutiny from civil rights groups , Rumsfeld has been studying how such trials could be held while protecting the rights of any defendants and keeping tight security over the US war on terrorism declared by Bush after the attacks .
The hero of the Gulf War , Colin Powell , did not exactly cover himself in glory in his diplomatic mission to the Middle East as the US president 's envoy .
His task was to create " a peaceful environment " in the region currently affected by an unrecognized and undeclared war between Israel and Palestine .
The man who defeated Iraq in 1991 in only six weeks issued a message , saying that the most he hoped for was something less than a mutual cease-fire agreement .
Another round of talks will be held today between Powell and the chief players in the Middle East .
But the current development of events , that is , the standstill situation , makes it clear that US foreign policy has been put to a very serious test in which the United States needs to discipline its decades-long ally , Israel , and not ruin its relations with the Arabs .
The impression is that , under US sponsorship , the international community deliberated too long about the violence in the Middle East .
The latest round of violence was initiated on the day in September 2000 when Ariel Sharon took it upon himself to provoke his Muslim neighbors by visiting an Islamic religious building .
Sharon , who used to be a colonel and who is directly responsible for the massacre in the Beirut camps Sabra and Shatila , used his return to power as an opportunity to settle the accounts with his years-long enemies .
Powell 's words , " we are working on this plan , " are unclear , because he did not say what the plan is , and Israel 's call for a conference on the Middle East is also unclear .
In relation to the first ambiguity , Powell 's words definitely can not be taken seriously , considering that precisely Washington is the one that has been practicing a one-sided approach to the events in the Middle East for 18 months now and it was the chief opponent of the positioning of peace troops between the two warring sides .
With an average $ 3 billion military aid for Israel and a strong Jewish lobby at home , the Untied States can not play any other role in the Middle East conflict but protector of the Israeli state .
In its warnings and appeals for peace , the United States openly " takes a side " in this conflict , labeling the other side terrorists , similar to those who carried out the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York .
It would be entirely improper if , in its defense of Israel , the United States continues to exert pressure on neighboring Arab countries , such as , Syria and Lebanon , which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations , such as the Hezbolah .
It is worrying that among Powell 's priorities in Beirut were the talks on the activities of the Hezbolah , with an announcement that terrorists might open a new front .
In some circles , these concerns over an alleged new front are seen as an attempt to resolve the smaller Israel-Palestine problem with a bigger one .
For example , a new Israeli-Arab war .
The international community received a lot of negative points for the Middle East .
Maybe Joschka Fischer 's plan for suspending Germany 's military aid for Israel , that is , possible EU economic sanctions against Tel Aviv is honorable , but it is a late and disturbingly long-term plan .
Europe does not have a united stance on the violence in Ramallah , Nablus , Bethlehem , and the Palestinian refugee camps , despite the clear situation that Israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state .
The EU 's efforts and US President Bush 's peace initiative through Secretary of State Powell seem like a late resolution , considering that approximately one month ago the Arab countries participating in the summit in Beirut held out an olive branch to Israel through the plan of Saudi Arabia 's heir to the throne , Prince Abdullah , which contained two points : recognition of a Palestinian state [ as published ] in an Arab neighborhood , in return for recognition of the Palestinians ' right to their own country .
Israel did not even have the goodness to look at this plan , demonstrating arrogance toward everything Arab .
In the same manner Israel asked Arafat to leave Ramallah and Palestine , labeling him a troublemaker and politician incapable of controlling the Palestinian suicide bombers .

The Kimberley Provincial Hospital said it would probably know by Tuesday whether one of its patients had Congo Fever .
Medical Department head Dr Hamid Saeed said the patient 's blood had been sent to the Institute for Virology in Johannesburg for analysis and the results of the first two sets of tests -- for illnesses other than Congo fever -- arrived back on Monday night and were negative .
A set of tests specifically for Congo fever were still outstanding .
Saeed said indications were that those tests would be negative too .
He said it was his opinion that the patient -- a woman -- was suffering from tick bite fever .
The two have similar symptoms .
The woman was admitted to the hospital on Saturday after complaining of severe joint pains .
She also had a skin rash and was vomiting .
The patient told hospital authorities she became sick after being bitten by a tick about four months ago .
Although the woman 's condition had deteriorated on Sunday it was showing improvement on Monday .
By afternoon she was conversing with her husband after being semi-comatose in the morning .
Between one and 10 cases of Congo Fever are reported in South Africa annually , with about 20 to 25 percent of patients dying , according to statistics from the virology institute .
A total of 158 cases of Congo Fever were diagnosed in southern Africa between 1981 and the end of 2000 .
Early symptoms of the disease include severe headaches , red eyes , fevers and cold chills , body pain , and vomiting .
The disease can be contracted if a person is bitten by a certain tick or if a person comes into contact with the blood of a Congo Fever sufferer .
More Prisoners Detained in Guantanamo Bay Join Hunger Strike
Strike Triggered by a TurbanAccording to military sources at the U.S. base , the hunger striker was first triggered on Wednesday when the guard took the turban off the detainee 's head while he was still praying .
The sources argued that it was against the rules of the prison because the turban could be used to conceal a weapon .
Bush Criticized for Treating Detainees InhumanelyAs more inmates joined the hunger strike , some of them reportedly chanted rhythmically on Thursday .
Prison officials have reportedly strengthened the already heavy security at the prison for precautions .
The Bush administration has been under international criticism for not treating the detainees humanely .
It recently bowed to international pressure to grant the Taliban prisoners the status of prisoner of war but still refused to cover al Qaeda prisoners with the same treatment .
TAIPEI , Feb 17 ( AFP ) - Taiwan is keeping a wary eye on US President George W. Bush 's China visit despite assurances by Washington that Taipei 's interests would not be traded away during the trip .
Washington had guaranteed Taipei that it would not dilute its backing for the island in return for better relations with Beijing , Taiwan 's foreign ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yueh told AFP .
" Through some proper channels , we have been told that there should not be surprises " during Bush 's visit to China , she said .
The top US official handling Taiwan affairs , Richard Bush -- no relation of the president -- also moved to ease Taipei 's concerns during his visit to the island last month .
" He made it clear that relations between Taipei and Washington are getting better , " said Joseph Wu , deputy director of National Chengchi University 's Institute of International Relations .
Richard Bush is chairman and managing director of the Washington-based American Institute in Taiwan ( AIT ) -- a body authorised by Washington to handle exchanges with Taipei since it switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 .
The US president embarked on a week-long tour of Asia late Saturday with stopovers planned in Japan , South Korea and China .
President Bush will hold a working summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing on February 21-22 .
Wu said he believed overall Taiwan interests were protected from knocks by the Bush administration because of the island 's " strong support " from decision-makers in the White House , State Department and Department of Defense .
Washington announced in April 2001 the most comprehensive arms package to Taipei since 1992 , including four Kidd-class destroyers , eight diesel submarines and 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft .
The sale infuriated Beijing which regards Taiwan an integral part of its territory awaiting reunification , by force if necessary .
On the eve of his departure for Asia , Bush said he would discuss with Beijing trade issues arising from China 's entry into the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , the global war on terrorism and the fate of Taiwan .
The president has called for a peaceful resolution of the lingering sovereignty dispute between Taipei and Beijing which split at the end of a civil war in 1949 .
But Taiwanese officials are nonetheless concerned .
The foreign ministry has set up an ad hoc group which will monitor Bush 's Asian trip around-the-clock and report back to President Chen Shui-bian , Chang said , adding that Taiwan 's de facto embassy in Washington had been given a similar task .
Compounding fears is speculation that Bush may sign a fresh communique with China in return for Beijing 's support on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear proliferation .
The two countries have sealed three joint communiques since the end of the 1970s .
The first was issued during then-president Richard Nixon 's landmark trip to China in 1972 while another one , signed during the Ronald Reagan era , agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan .
Wu defended the government 's cautious approach warning that Beijing could try to use the situation to gain the upper hand .
" Taiwan 's interest would be harmed if the Chinese leaders took advantage of the occasion by making remarks unfavorable to Taipei and Washington failed to defend Taipei , " Wu warned .
Taipei was angered when then-president Bill Clinton pledged the " three nos " during his China visit in 1998 .
Clinton said he did not support independence for Taiwan , the policy of " two Chinas " or " one China , one Taiwan " and agreed that Taiwan should not be a member of any organisation to which statehood is a requirement .
Seoul , Aug. 29 ( Yonhap ) -- LG Electronics Co. said Wednesday that it has established a code division multiple access ( CDMA ) mobile phone service system in Tashkent , Uzbekistan , to begin service on Sept. 1 , Uzbekistan 's Independence Day .
The opening ceremony for the CDMA system was held there Monday with LG Electronics Co. President Park Chung-gun , Uzbek Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Isaev , Perfect Mobile President Alexey Martinson and other dignitaries attending , an LG spokesman said .
LG signed a contract in March for the shipment of the CDMA equipment with Perfect Mobile , which has the exclusive right to do CDMA business in the central Asian state .
LG has established 30,000 circuits of 800 Megahertz CDMA system in Tashkent , the Uzbek capital , and is planning to increase the facility to up to 200,000 circuits by 2004 .
LG also plans to upgrade the current system beginning 2002 .
President Park said that the opening of the LG CDMA mobile phone service in Uzbekistan will have an impact on neighboring central Asian states .
" We hope that this will serve as an occasion for LG to make inroads into the Central Asian region. " Uzbekistan is the largest country in central Asia with a population of 23 million and rich in natural resources .
The state-run Uzbektelecom and four private companies offering services in the Global System for Mobile Communications ( GMS ) has about 100,000 subscribers .
It 's not another ice age , but at least it 's cooler
As countries gear up for battles over ratifying the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , a recent study suggests that the world already has stepped along the path to a future cooler than it might have been .
Researchers at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) in New York report that declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere 's ability to retain heat .
The researchers link the slower rate to implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol , in which countries agreed to phase out production of gases that erode the Earth 's protective ozone layer .
Known collectively as chlorofluorocarbons , these gases also trap heat thousands of times as effectively as carbon dioxide - the main focus of Kyoto .
If the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had been maintained at the peak reached in 1980 , the climate by 2050 would have reached temperatures not currently anticipated until 2100 , when CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere are expected to have doubled , the researchers calculate .
The slowdown also " is due in part to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide , for reasons that are n't well understood and need more study , " notes James Hansen , the NASA researcher who conducted the study with Makiko Sato , also with the GISS .
The slower growth in carbon-dioxide concentrations could be due to increased CO 2 uptake by land-based plants and marine organisms , he suggests .
The work grows out of a longer-term effort by the two scientists to explore paths to adjusting the globe 's thermostat other than the politically charged effort embodied in the Kyoto Protocol .
By focusing on carbon dioxide , the pact sets its sights on curbing the greenhouse gas held most responsible for contributing to the climate 's warming during the past century .
But curbs on CO 2 mean curbs on burning coal , oil , and natural gas - the fuels of booming economies .
Drs. Hansen and Sato argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as black carbon soot , ozone ( smog ) in the lower atmosphere , and methane from landfills , mining , and oil and gas production .
The duo calculates that by reducing methane emissions by 30 percent , for example , the effect on climate would be comparable to the effect from cuts in CO 2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol during its first commitment period , which runs from 2008 to 2012 .
Their study appeared in the Dec. 18 , 2001 , issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
Mugabe Predicts Victory in Zimbabwe 's Election
Zimbabwe 's incumbent President Robert Mugabe Saturday predicted victory in the country 's two- horse presidential race , saying that he will accept the outcome of the election because he will have defeated Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Looking tired but blithesome after more than a month of daily election campaigns throughout the southern African country , Mugabe cast his vote in a weekend presidential poll , in which he is facing a serious challenge from his main rival Tsvangirai .
The Zimbabwean veteran leader , who has been in power since the country gained independence from Britain in 1980 , was accompanied to the polling station at a school in the poor suburb of Highfield in the capital Harare by family members , including two children .
He told journalists after casting his ballot that he was more than confident of winning the election .
" I will accept the results more than anything because I will have won , " said Mugabe .
He said those who thought the election process would be rigged were supporters of the MDC party , adding that they were prejudging and wanted to direct the process .
Tension has risen sharply in Zimbabwe in recent months , after long and sometimes violent election campaigns .
The MDC party has accused Mugabe of using violence and other electoral manipulation to rig the poll .
While defying international pressure to back down from his controversial land reforms , Mugabe has said he needs a new six- year mandate to complete the reforms .
Under these reforms , the Zimbabwean government has taken over excess and idle farms from white farmers , who own the bulk of the country 's arable land , to resettle landless peasants .
Nearly 500,000 people have been resettled since the beginning of last year .
However , the program has drawn sharp international rebuke , particularly from former colonial power Britain , but Mugabe has vowed to press ahead with the reforms .
The European Union imposed sanctions on Mugabe and 19 of his close associates last month , while the United States took the same move , accusing Mugabe of violating human rights and cracking down on the opposition , the media and judiciary .
The controversial land reform is the pillar of Mugabe 's electoral strategy , which political analysts say could work either way .
In Mugabe 's view , the March election is a new chapter in his long struggle against colonial rule , which he led from the early 1960s until the country 's independence .
" We have to deliver and safeguard the most important heritage to the young generation - land - which was taken from our forefathers by force , " he told a recent rally .
Mugabe even talked about his desire to keep safeguarding Zimbabwe 's sovereignty and land in spirit when he dies , a dream which the veteran leader said forced him to sacrifice a bright teaching career in the 1950s to lead his compatriots out of colonial rule .
But that ambition would be fully tested at the ballot box this weekend .
Taro Kono ( 39 ) , son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and twice elected lower house Liberal Democratic Party member , wrote a critical comment on the US president 's speech before the Japanese Diet on 19 February .
The following is a translated excerpt from an article by Kono published in his e-mail magazine , Gomameno no Hagishiri ( Futile Resistance ) , on 19 February .
Kono issues his e-mail magazine almost daily .
" During President Bush 's speech , I thought of heckling ; 'What are you going to do with the Kyoto Protocol ? ' and 'How about CTBT ? ' but I refrained .
The President used the words 'common values , ' but is it really true ?
I think 'value sharing , ' not 'burden sharing ' or 'power sharing , ' is needed for today 's Japan-US relationship .
The United States says the CTBT is unacceptable ; that nobody cares about the BWC ; that there should not be a Kyoto Protocol ; that US citizens have the right to own handguns ; that land mines are necessary ; that the SOFA needs no revision , just a change in application ; and then we should attack Iraq together .
This is not acceptable .
Ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries immediately came and asked me what I thought of the President 's speech . "

US-Japan climate talks end
Representatives from Japan and the United States have finished two days of talks Tuesday on climate change in Tokyo .
They discussed ways of co-operating in the science and technology fields to prevent global warming .
The meeting was the first between the two countries since President George Bush unveiled a new US plan calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets .
At the start of the meeting , the US said it would promote research and development into climate change .
Japan says it still intends to ratify the Kyoto protocol .
President Bush caused an international outcry when he rejected the 1997 Kyoto protocol on climate change last year , saying it hindered US economic growth .
ISTANBUL , Dec 21 ( A.A ) - Rauf Denktas , the President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ( TRNC ) said on Friday that Cyprus is wanted to be given as a gift to those who stole the Cyprus government by means of EU membership .
`` I expect the Turkish world to resist to that as much as Turkey does and to act consciously to defend the law and justice , `` he said .
The Turkish States and Communities Friendship , Brotherhood and Cooperation Congress started the same day .
Addressing the meeting , Denktas said that this week is `` Martryrs Week , `` adding that `` it is the 38th anniversary of the struggle started to annihilate Turks in Cyprus ... We fought for half of our lives to prevent the occupation of Cyprus from Greece and not to make the island a Greek dagger that is thrust into the heart of Anatolia .
I wish the representatives of the Turkish world to bring this message to their friends. ``
Noting that the agreements signed in 1960 for Cyprus were considered as nonexistent by many countries , Denktas said that the international society treated the island as if it was a Greek Cypriot Republic and treated its Turkish partner as if it was a minority .
Denktas said that they are ready to live together with Greek Cypriots in the island , adding that they don ` t have the will to send Greek Cypriots from the island .
`` We wish them to give up their wish and policy to throw us from the island .
They should not condemn us with lies and by deceiving the world , `` he said .
Denktas noted that there is no Cypriot nation in the island and there can ` t be a minority if there is no nation , stressing that he will launch efforts to make Cyprus a friendship bridge between Turkey and Greece .
Calling on the representatives of the Turkish world who attended the congress , Denktas said that Turkish Cypriots are not minority in the island and representatives should explain this fact in every place which they visit .
Also asking for help from the Turkish press , Denktas said that `` I ask for help from the press as I will negotiate for peace and compromise to solve Cyprus question .
I would like these representatives to explain the fact to the EU , which forgot the 1960 Constitution that the Turkish Cypriots are not minority and the Greek Cypriot side which wants to join the EU unilaterally and as if it was the legitimate government of Cyprus is not expected in the EU. ``

Mugabe rigged Zimbabwe polls : Britain
LONDON : British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Tuesday there was already " pretty strong " early evidence that President Robert Mugabe had " stolen " the election in Zimbabwe .
Although he refused to make a final judgement on the conduct of the weekend presidential poll , he told parliament that if Mugabe was declared the winner of a rigged vote , it would have " enormous implications " for London 's ties with Harare .
" If it becomes clear , and the evidence is already pretty strong , that President Mugabe , in the event he is declared the winner , has stolen the election , then that has enormous implications for the nature of our relationship with Zimbabwe , " he warned .
" This is a terrible period , not only for Zimbabwe but for those who hold the course of democracy dear in Africa and elsewhere . "
Counting in the election , in which Mugabe is battling for his political future against opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai after 22 years in power , began Tuesday amid complaints in Zimbabwe over the conduct of the vote .
A group of independent local observers said the electoral process was neither free nor fair and could spark fresh violence in the southern African country .
Straw said there had been " every sign " of intimidation by Mugabe 's Zanu-PF party up to the close of polls as well as many reports of irregularities since then , including shortage of polling booths in urban areas and harassment of opposition election agents in rural areas .
JOHANNESBURG March 16 Sapa MBEKI TO MEET WITH MUGABE AND TSVANGIRAI IN HARARE ON MONDAY
( CORRECTS TITLE OF AUSTRALIAN PM , UPDATES WITH ZUMA ATTENDING INAUGURATION ) President Thabo Mbeki would fly to Harare on Monday to meet Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and later with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , presidential spokesman Bheki Khumalo told Sapa on Saturday .
Khumalo said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo would also attend the talks , which would culminate on Tuesday when the two met Australian Prime Minister John Howard in London .
Mugabe was to be inaugurated again as Zimbabwean president on Sunday following his controversial re-election last weekend .
He was first elected Prime Minister in 1980 and has effectively ruled the country ever since .
Mbeki , Obasanjo and Howard have been mandated by the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting ( CHOGM ) in Australia to decide what action should be taken on the situation in Zimbabwe .
Their decision would be based on the Commonwealth observer team 's report on the legitimacy of the election as well as those prepared by the Southern African Development Community , the Organisation of African Unity and the SA Observer Mission .
The Commonwealth team earlier this week said that " the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow the free and fair expression of will by the electorate " .
The SADC on Saturday endorsed the vote , despite its Parliamentary Forum , which judging that the March 9-11 election " did not conform with the norms and standards of the SADC Parliamentary Forum , " signed on to by Zimbabwe .
The team from the organisation 's Council of Ministers , on the other hand , considered the vote a " true reflection " of the people 's will .
The Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) also backed Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe 's re-election , with its observer team describing the poll as " transparent , credible , free and fair " .
South Africa 's observer mission also endorsed the vote , saying in an interim report that " ( o ) verall ... the authorities charged with conducting the elections discharged their work satisfactorily . "
The team acknowledged that the election campaign had been characterised by " polarisation , tension and incidents of violence and intimidation . "
In terms of the Commonwealth 's mandate , action against Zimbabwe could range from collective disapproval to suspension .
Mbeki was , however , already on the record as saying that the Commonwealth also had other issues to consider .
CHOGM had also decided to look at ways of helping Zimbabwe with land reform and food aid .
State-sanctioned land invasions , several times declared illegal by Zimbabwe 's courts , as well as a drought have disrupted Zimbabwe 's food production and famine is already looming in much of the country .
Meanwhile , Foreign Affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Mbeki 's deputy , Jacob Zuma would represent the country at the controversially re-elected President Robert Mugabe 's latest inauguration , scheduled for Sunday in Harare .
No reason was provided why Mbeki could not attend .
Reports from Lagos indicated that Obasanjo would also not attend .
Several other heads of state had by Saturday indicated they would attend , including Tanzania 's Benjamin Nkapa and Malawi 's Bakili Muluzi , currently also the SADC 's president .
Mamoepa said the key points on the agenda now was Zimbabwe 's economic recovery and social stability " within the context of national unity . "
JAMMU , India , Jan 12 ( AFP ) -- Four Pakistani soldiers were killed Saturday in cross-border shelling in Kashmir , Indian officials said .
Lieutenant Colonel H.S. Oberoi said Pakistani troops had started shelling Indian border villages in the Krishna Ghati area of Poonch , 255 kilometres ( 158 miles ) northwest of Jammu , Kashmir 's winter capital .
Indian forces retaliated , killing four Pakistani soldiers and destroying six bunkers , he said .
He said there were no Indian casualties , although some homes , which had been deserted by villagers , were damaged .
Chinese space exploration : When will a Chinese cosmonaut fly into space ?
Shenzhou-3 orbited the Earth 108 times , and successfully landed on the targeted site in inner Mongolia : the Chinese space program is developing .
The 47th congress of the International Federation of Astronautics that took place six years ago in Beijing was remarkable for the large number of cosmonauts who participated .
There was even an Austrian there , but the country who organized the forum , the third country on the rating of space explorers , was not represented .
This can partially be explained with the third position on the rating .
A Czech , Austrian , Bulgarian , or a Dutch citizen is not entitled to give the command " Go ! " like Yury Gagarin did if they are only guests on the Russian Soyuz station or American Shuttle .
China will not agree to put its citizens on a foreign spaceship , as it must launch its own space vehicle from its own cosmodrome .
Mao Tse-tung was passionate about this idea .
Here is an interesting detail from his unpublished " Moscow speech " that was delivered to Chinese students studying in Russia .
Mao Tse-tung mentioned the fact of the recent Soviet launch of the first ever satellite , weighing 70 kilos ; then he turned to the Chinese ambassador and asked him : " Do you weigh 70 kilos , ambassador Liu Xiao ?
" A bit less than that , " was the answer .
" There you see !
The Soviet Union can launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space !
America can not do it so far .
Was it only the wish of socialist propaganda in those words ?
That speech was delivered on November 15 , 1957 , and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China authorized its rocket production program a year before that , in October of 1956 ( on Mao Tse-tung 's initiative ) .
The specialized Fifth Institute of the Defense Ministry was established for that purpose .
Two years ago , in October of 1955 , Beijing received a person with the reputation of the " Chinese Korolev " Qian Xuesen , who came to China from the USA , where he had settled after graduating from Shanghai university , so it would be better to call him " Chinese von Broun . "
Xuesen continued his studies at California Technical University , having obtained a Doctor of Astronautics degree , and , as the say , the title of US Air Force colonel .
He then was employed at a US Air Force rocket engine lab and succeeded there .
In the summer of 1950 , he made an attempt to move to Beijing .
FBI agents caught him and his wife at the airport of Los Angeles , as well as luggage that contained 896 pounds of books and records .
Xuesen was released only after five years only , after the " quarantine " during which he was not allowed access to the secret information .
Xuesen became the supervisor of the research works in the field , but the Chinese spaceships of the Shenzhou type looked like the Russian Soyuz , specialists say .
At the same time , when the Chinese von Broun managed to reach China , there were other bearers of fresher secrets there from the country , which could " launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space. " The Chinese students who graduated from Russian universities and Soviet experts of nuclear and missile technologies .
The " elder brother " ( the Chinese people used to call the Soviet Union this ) was not against helping the " younger brother " in the field of modernization .
By the time of Mao Tse-tung 's " Moscow speech , " the Chinese were actively searching for a site for their rocket range .
The committee of the competent departments prepared seven variants with the help of Soviet experts .
The choice was made for a site in the Gobi Desert .
The construction of the Jiuquan cosmodrome was started there ; it was put into operation at the end of 1958 .
China 's three ( unmanned ) spaceships were launched into space from there :
Shenzhou-1 was launched on November 20 , 1999 ; it stayed in the orbit for about 24 hours , having orbited the Earth 14 times .
Shenzhou-2 blasted off on January 10 , 2001 , staying about a week in the orbit , having flown 108 times around the planet .
Shenzhou-3 ( blasted off on March 25 ) stayed in space for the same period of time , with the same number of circuits around the Earth .
The current goal is to examine the module and its contents ( like in the first two cases ) .
However , it is evident now that China has reliable rocket systems ; it has mastered the art of space navigation and soft landing of a spaceship .
China knows how to build its own spaceships , and there are people who can become cosmonauts .
Their training is in full swing ( Russia is reportedly participating ) .
As China 's experts believe , there should be at least four test unmanned flights performed before they can launch a man into space .
Therefore , the " Chinese Gagarin " will probably say " Go ! " no later than 2005 .
China is also working on programs for Chinese cosmonauts to fly to the Moon , as well as a space station .
Dear , A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill 's help .
Here 's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source : Goodwill 's controller , Juli .
She tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $ 49 million dollars .
In addition to that , by helping them find jobs , Goodwill reduced the state's Public Support tab by an estimated $ 4 million .
Your gift to Goodwill will help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly support our work .
What kind of work does Goodwill do ?
Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities .
After Maureen 's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant , we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society .
Remember what she said in my last letter ?
If I was n't working here ...
I would be sad ...
Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance .
Sherry learned through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family .
At Goodwill she gained in self-confidence , in her vision of her future and in the job skills she needed to find and keep a good job .
Coming to Goodwill was the first step toward my becoming totally independent .
I am now ...
totally off of welfare .
Goodwill prepares people for life-long employment .
Cornell found a number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a work-site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry .
He trained in desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with new-found skills in a burgeoning industry .
I 've got more than a job ; I 've got a career .
Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill .
After a lifetime of trials , Donna not only earned her GED at Goodwill , she earned a job here .
I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow .
I wanted to be there ...
I had my second chance to change my life .
Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success .
Your support will help them go to work .
Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill today !
Sincerely , William A Carter , Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation P.S. Your gift is a wise investment in the community .
For every dollar donated to Goodwill in 1998 , we helped our " graduates " earn an estimated $ 102 .
That money was then spent in a variety of ways , adding fuel to our thriving economy .
C'wealth mission conduct questionable
By A Special Correspondent - Britain 's Prime Minister , Tony Blair , privately did two things concerning Zimbabwe during the recent " retreat " by Commonwealth leaders in Australia that raise questions about today 's meeting in London by the troika of Australia , Nigeria and South Africa .
The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote .
But how could Blair have " a Commonwealth report " when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the Secretariat to all members , asked one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders at the retreat ?
The British leader fudged his reply and the Commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the " Blair report " had already been written in London before the Commonwealth mission even left for Zimbabwe .
Their mission was simply to rubber stamp the adverse report that Britain had already written .
Blair 's second faux pas in Australia , according to some of the assembled Commonwealth leaders , came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by Zimbabwe 's Foreign Minister , Dr Stan Mudenge .
The Nigerian leader , President Olusegun Obasanjo , had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain 's negative position regarding Zimbabwe , but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner .
The Zimbabwean minister did this .
Then Mudenge rose to his feet , strode over to Blair and thrust out his hand .
The hand symbolised reconciliation ; and Blair accepted it .
Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future .
The Commonwealth leaders , many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between Zimbabwe and its former coloniser , Britain , breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process .
But there was still an unanswered question in the minds of the Commonwealth leaders : How had the British Prime Minister seen the purported " Commonwealth report on Zimbabwe " when they had not ?
Meanwhile , back in Harare , some strange things were happening with the Commonwealth mission .
They had been pre-booked by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the partly Government-owned Sheraton Hotel .
On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front ( Zanu-PF ) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building , the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel .
There , unlike the Sheraton where the national newspaper The Herald is distributed to guests , the pro-opposition Daily News is given freely to guests .
Furthermore , as anyone who has been following the Zimbabwean Press can testify , many of the Meikles farms around the country have been acquired by the State as part of the land reform programme .
Meikles Hotel has long been known as a hot bed of opposition politics .
During the 2000 parliamentary elections , 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) .
But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government , the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election .
While the Commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel , the opposition leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , Morgan Tsvangirai , moved in with them , taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage .
It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel .
There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission .
Instead , an Australian member of the Federal Parliament , Julie Bishop , vented her anger towards the President and Government , and the electoral process , in Australia 's media .
The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions .
Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers ?
Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent , neutral persons .
A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission , who is the well-respected , Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country , held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known .
Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of " consensus " , she and others of a similar view were dismissed as " troublemakers " by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer .
The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister , John Howard , ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday 's inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe .
The Australians , in common with other white members of the Commonwealth , the European Union ( EU ) , the Americans , Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State .
These are some of the realities that Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa , confronted as they flew from Harare last night for their meeting in London tomorrow with the Australian leader who is the third member of the Commonwealth troika .
Howard , however , will not be isolated at the three-member meeting at Marlborough House in London .
The Commonwealth Secretary-General , Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country 's decision to condemn Zimbabwe 's presidential election .
And close by , Howard will have the British government and the western media .
Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki , however , have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth .
And , in line with Commonwealth consensus , the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole .
No doubt Blair will fight on .
But the solution to the present impasse lies with the people of Zimbabwe and Africa , not with the people of Britain and Europe .
The European Parliament , which convened yesterday in Strasbourg , decided to advise the 15 member states of the European Union to impose economic sanctions on Israel and , specifically , to suspend association agreements with Jerusalem .
In addition , the Parliament called for imposing a weapons embargo on Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
For some time , European politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with Israel -- a move , which in light of close and extensive trade relations between EU member states and Israel , could cause serious damage .
Earlier this week , Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel , who does not miss an opportunity to provoke Israel , threatened that the EU would once again reconsider its relations with Jerusalem .
European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed similar sentiments : in his opinion , the EU should consider imposing an economic " punishment " on Israel in protest against the operations of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories .
The same goes for Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique , who was offended after Israel refused to allow him and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah .
Despite the Parliament 's recommendation , the chances that the association agreements will be suspended are very slim .
It takes more than a recommendation from the European Parliament for this to happen ; the decision has to be taken by both the European Commission and the EU 's Council of Foreign Ministers , on which all 15 foreign ministers sit , and has to be unanimous .
Countries like France and Belgium are easily capable of voting for sanctions against Israel , but other states -- including Germany and Britain -- have exhibited a more balanced position regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
However , the fact that certain countries have a more balanced view of the conflict is not the only reason to doubt that anti-Israeli decisions will , in fact , be adopted .
The Europeans know that repeated denunciations of Israel , not to mention its punishment , will not lead to a solution of the conflict .
Israel will not change its positions on vital security issues , even if the European states eliminate customs breaks afforded to Israeli exports .
If the Europeans wish to influence Israel in the political arena -- in a direction that many in Israel would support wholeheartedly -- they will not be able to promote their positions in such a manner .
A unilateral move is likely to prejudice Europe 's status in helping to find a solution to the conflict .
EU External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten expressed this clearly Tuesday when he said that canceling the association agreements between Israel and the EU would do nothing to enhance Jerusalem 's readiness to listen to European representatives .
What holds true with regard to threats by EU leaders also holds true for threats expressed by certain European states and the means of punishment they might already be implementing .
There have been reports that vital components German factories are supposed to supply to the defense establishment are arriving slowly , as is the case regarding the arrival of vital supplies from other European countries .
One can not assume that Israel will act under the pressure of deeds and oversights that are often tainted with a significant degree of hypocrisy .
TOKYO , Feb 18 ( AFP ) -- US President George W. Bush said Monday that all options were on the table to deal with Iraq , Iran and North Korea , even as Germany warned against any " adventure " in Iraq .
At the start of his Asian tour , Bush dismissed a chilly reception by US allies to his " axis of evil " rhetoric , telling reporters in Tokyo , " I will keep all options on the table .
" We want to resolve all issues peacefully , whether it be Iraq , Iran or North Korea , " Bush said , speaking next to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi .
Bush has lumped those three countries together in what terms an " axis of evil , " in language that has riled US allies .
The president renewed his pledge to thwart terrorist groups who want to " mate up " with regimes hoping to acquire weapons of mass destruction and said " nations will come with us " if the US-led war on terrorism is extended .
" People who love freedom understand that we can not allow nations that are n't transparent , nations with a terrible history , nations that are so dictatorial they 're willing to starve their people , we ca n't allow them to mate up with terrorist organizations , " Bush said .
Asked about French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine 's criticism of the " axis " concept as " simplistic , " Bush said : " I understand what happens in the international arena ; people say things .
" But the leaders I 've talked to understand , exactly , what needs to happen .
" They understand that our commitment is not just in Afghanistan , that history has given us a unique opportunity to defend freedom , " he added .
Bush , who arrived in Tokyo Sunday at the start of a week-long trip that will also take him to Seoul and Beijing , held talks with Koizumi on the war effort in Afghanistan .
But the leaders did not " specifically " talk about military action against any other country , a senior US administration official said .
Bush is due to travel to Seoul Tuesday and the following day will visit the heavily fortified no-man 's land between South Korea and communist North Korea .
The United States maintains some 37,000 troops on the Korean peninsula , and Bush has called the de-militarised zone dividing South Korea from its hardline communist northern neighbour " one of the most dangerous places on earth " .
But his tough stand on P'yongyang has provoked concern in Seoul , where President Kim Tae-chung , who is in the last year of his five-year term , has been trying to prise the hermit state out of isolation .
South Korean ministers fear Bush 's tough talking may put back by years Kim 's so-called Sunshine Policy of establishing a permanent peace .
Angry anti-US protests erupted in Seoul ahead of Bush 's arrival with police storming the American Chamber of Commerce and detaining 32 students occupying the building .
During the three-hour occupation , protesters hurled leaflets proclaiming Bush to be a " war freak " .
US diplomats say Bush will seek to support Kim 's Nobel Prize winning policy by offering new talks with the North , while remaining firm about North Korea 's missile sales and its feared chemical and biological weapons programmes .
North Korea remains unconvinced , calling Bush the head of " an empire of evil. " Its state media said last week that Bush " is the most bellicose and heinous " US president , and added his visit was only intended to " fan up war hysteria " .
Even though US officials have stressed that no firm military plans exist for expanding the war on terror launched after the September 11 attacks , they said late Sunday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should go .
" We 've made no secret of the fact that we think that the world will be much safer when the Iraqi people have a regime that they deserve instead of the regime that they have , " National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told CBS television .
Washington has long accused Baghdad , under UN sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , of developing weapons of mass destruction .
But Baghdad insisted Sunday it could not be a threat to the United States .
" It is the United States that is threatening Iraq and not the contrary .
They are the ones attacking Iraq , not the other way round , " said Ath-Thawra , mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party in Baghdad .
" Even if Iraq possessed such weapons , it could not threaten the United States .
How could it threaten a country that possesses weapons of mass destruction that could destroy entire planets ? "
In Berlin , Germany 's chief government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye told journalists , " The federal government can not imagine that the United States government has an interest in engaging in an adventure " in Iraq .
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had pledged " undivided support " for the fight against terrorism a week after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , saying , " Germany is ready for risks , including military ones , but not for adventures . "
He had also insisted on the right of the allies to be informed and consulted about US plans .
The German government spokesman said it would be " useful " if UN observers could enter Iraq again to check for weapons of mass destruction .
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer last week sharply criticised Bush 's " axis of evil " remarks , telling a newspaper that such a concept " gets us nowhere . "
Iran , which has long had tense relations with its western neighbor , voiced opposition to a new US strike against Iraq .
" We hope that the issue would be solved through peaceful means , with initiatives from the UN secretary general and a more active role by the UN , " Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi told a news conference .
" We also hope that Iraq gives a favourable response and allows UN weapon inspectors " to return to the country , he added .
Kharazi said that some 150 foreigners arrested recently on Iran 's border with Pakistan were not members of the al-Qaeda terror network , but admitted some could be sympathisers and would be sent back to their home countries .
Among those being held were 40 women , between 70 and 80 children and a number of men of European , North African and Middle East origin , including a handful of Afghans .
A diplomatic source said the affair could become " embarrassing " for European countries , " because of the insistence of the Americans on judging for themselves " those who supported al-Qaeda .
Washington alleges that Tehran has allowed al-Qa'ida fighters and members of the Taliban regime to enter Iran , which Iranian officials have hotly denied but said they would act if provided with evidence .
In another verbal attack Kharazi accused the United States of wanting to exercise " world dictatorship " since the " horrible attacks " of September 11 .
" America 's rulers have proved that they can not be trusted , " he said .
" They are seeking unilaterally to become the masters of the world and want to sweep aside all competitors from other countries . "
Afghan interim Interior Minister Yunus Qanooni told AFP that two suspects in last week 's murder of aviation and tourism minister Abdul Rahman had been arrested in Saudi Arabia and could be sent back to Afghanistan .
Hi my name is Sandra Reid and I am part of a family of seven children , um , and my mom and dad have passed away .
During our young years we were very poor .
We did not have very much but my mom always found a way to keep us busy or keep us entertained , and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories , reading poems , and singing to us .
One of the stories that I would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary and it sticks out into my mind , I guess , mostly , mainly because it was scary .
Even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that it was we were OK .
Out of all of my sisters and brothers I was the laziest one of all , as far as working around the house .
All of my sisters learned to cook by the age of eight .
I learned after I got married so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking .
So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes .
Naturally , I start crying , and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me , either my stomach , or that I had a headache , or something was wrong with my leg .
Just anything to get out of doing my job .
So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow , do what she tell told me to do , she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family .
So she began to tell this story .
Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family .
And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up , wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table .
And her little girl just complained , " I do n't want to wash the dishes .
I do n't want to .
My leg hurts , my head hurts .
I do n't feel good .
The little girl disappointed her mother so badly , but her mother said , " How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes ?
So she said , " Little girl , little girl , if you do n't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked , you something really , really bad is going to happen to you .
So the little girl just said , " OK I 'll go in there and wash the dishes .
And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time .
All of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it began to roll around in the air .
And before you know it , the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl 's head off .
And when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying " Daddy , Daddy !
Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife .
Now that knife , when I went to sleep it really scared me .
But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that I was OK .
Now after that , my mother continued to tell us many , many scary stories and tell us many , many , many poems .
I 'd like to tell you about how I got into becoming a teacher 's assistant .
All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school .
That was my dream , to teach school .
As I told you , in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this .
Uh , while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said , " Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward , on your grant to go to college .
So she said , " Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we , you know , can follow through with applying for a grant , scholarship grant for you .
So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said , " Baby , I really want you to go to college .
It 's always been my dream that my children all go to school .
But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you 're going to have to have to go to school and I just do n't have the money .
At that time my dad was in prison at the time , so it made it really hard for my mom .
I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us .
So I never got a chance to go to school .
Did anybody ?
Yes , my brother went to school .
He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith , so to make it easier on my mom , to , as far as , you know , him staying at home and going to school too .
So he graduated from , um , Johnson C. Smith , here in Charlotte .
I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there .
I , in later years , I went on to college some but I did n't complete the , uh , whole four years .
Um , I remember once , when I was working in a mill , and I was spinning yarn , and I was saying to myself , and , I was praying actually , and I said , " God , one day I want to work in the school system .
If I could just work , even as a teacher assistant I would be happy .
As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said , " Have you considered being a teacher assistant ?
I said , " I would love to .
So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont .
I 'd never gone to college before .
I was really afraid .
But he told me to go ahead and try it , so I took the entrance test , and they accepted me into at the school , and I took some courses there .
After a while , the principal said , " I would like for you to bring me your , um , transcript so I can see what your grades are like .
Luckily I had all A 's .
I did very well .
And he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year .
Um , my dream , my prayers were answered .
I enjoy my job very much .
I ca n't think of any job that would make me any happier .
A few years later , um , I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education .
At first I did n't want to apply for it , but the principal called me during the summer months and said , " Sandra the time is running out , you need to apply .
And he told me I would have to write this paper .
Well I did n't like writing at the time but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper .
And I went to , um , one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it , and she thought it was an excellent paper .
And I went ahead and mailed it in thinking uh I wo n't get the scholarship .
Who cares ?
I do n't , just so I can work in the school I 'll be happy .
But one day I came in and I looked at my mail and I was accepted .
I could n't believe it .
Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity , so I felt very proud of myself .
So I went on and took the courses , and as I started I think I was taking economics .
I think that was the last class I took .
My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school .
But you would have been able to be a , a teacher if you had continued ?
Yeah , and at the time , I was also working in the classroom .
I guess you 'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence .
And they hired a sub but the sub did n't do that much .
I had to take over the classroom .
So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband .
After all of this was , after I , I decided not to continue I 've never pursued the fact of going back to school .
I just got to a certain age and I said , " No I ca n't do this anymore , " so I never went back .
But I love what I do and , uh , anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so .
How many different schools did you teach at ?
I 've only worked at two , two schools .
The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down .
So I was in those situations where I first , come first , transfer last , come first to transfer out .
So I had to , I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill .
I did n't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really , really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park .
But then , after awhile , I fell in love with Berryhill .
If I 'm not mistaken I think I 've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years , 17 , 18 years I 've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire .
And why did the other school close down ?
Um , the , you know , I really do n't know .
Um , that , I really do n't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything , but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym , and I do n't think they used that gym no more than three years .
I really do n't , I do n't remember why that school was ever closed but it was .
And I enjoy what I do .
That 's it .
All right thank you .
Thank you .
DELHI. April 4 ( Interfax ) - The situation in Central Asia is stable and all threats to its security have been warded off , Russian Security Council Secretary Vladimir Rushailo told Russian journalists in Delhi on Thursday .
He said in answer to an Interfax question that " the situation in Central Asia is on the whole stable . "
" The anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan has lessened threats to regional security , but not removed them completely , " he said .
Concerning the presence of the U.S. and its NATO allies in the region , Rushailo said that the Russian position on cooperation between the Central Asian states and the anti-terrorist coalition is well known .
" We support it .
Each state has the sovereign right to determine the forms and methods of its participation in the coalition , " he said .
" However , this right should not be exercised to the detriment of the legitimate interests of neighboring states .
This is one of the most important rules of the international community , " Rushailo said .
Banja Luka , Dec 4 ( ONASA ) -- Republika Srpska [ Serb Republic -- RS ] Prime Minister Mladen Ivanic on Tuesday [ 4 December ] departed to an official visit to China , which is to last until December 9 , read a statement from the RS government 's public affairs bureau .
Ivanic is to meet with Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen and discuss possibilities for economic and other forms of cooperation .
Ivanic and Finance Minister Milenko Vracar are to meet with the governor of province Hebei Niu Maosheng , who invited them to the visit , and other officials of this province .
MANILA , Nov 24 ( AFP ) - President Gloria Arroyo praised Malaysia on Saturday for the swift arrest of Muslim leader Nur Misuari , whose forces embarked on a fresh rebellion this week in the southern Philippines .
Arroyo was " very satisfied that the Malaysian government has been efficient enough to arrest him , " her spokesman Rigoberto Tiglao told DZBB radio here .
Foreign department spokesman Victoriano Lecaros said the arrest should serve as " a warning to terrorists that they will find themselves on inhospitable ground within ASEAN , " referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations .
Tiglao separately told AFP that Manila would hold talks with Kuala Lumpur on the deportation of the former guerrilla leader turned politician .
The neighbors lack an extradition treaty .
He suggested that Kuala Lumpur would have to take the initiative , saying that Misuari had apparently violated Malaysian law by entering the country without a passport .
Manila wants to put Misuari on trial for rebellion in connection with a revolt on Monday which claimed at least 113 lives .
The Philippine foreign ministry this week cancelled Misuari 's regular and diplomatic passports as a Jolo court ordered his arrest .
He is the founder of the Moro National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) group and governor of the Muslim self-rule Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM ) .
Misuari launched his revolt after Arroyo decided to back an MNLF rival in an election to be held Monday to choose the next ARMM governor .
The government has deployed thousands of troops to Jolo to deter attempts by Misuari followers to disrupt the balloting .
Malaysia 's official Bernama news agency said that Misuari and six of his men were arrested on an island off the Malaysian state of Sabah , which is on Borneo island , while trying to enter the country illegally .
A source at the Malaysian embassy in Manila said the Royal Malaysian Police intercepted Misuari 's speedboat and arrested all its occupants .
The boat was being checked for weapons , said the source , who would not be identified .
Malaysia , which had given sanctuary to Misuari and his guerrillas in the early 1970s , has called on Misuari to end a bloody six-day-old rebellion by his followers in the southern Philippine island of Jolo .
Lecaros , from the foreign ministry , said the arrest was a sign that the ASEAN , " particularly Malaysia , is succeeding in the effort against terrorism . "
The group pledged to counter terrorism at a summit in Brunei this month as well as a summit with their main trading partners in Shanghai in October .
ASEAN includes Brunei , Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam .
Lecaros said that Misuari had developed ties with the Abu Sayyaf rebel group that has carried out a spree of kidnappings .
US and Philippine officials say the group has links with Saudi militant Osama bin Laden , blamed for the September 11 attacks on the United States that killed about 4,000 people .
" Misuari is not just any lawbreaking person , " Lecaros said .
" The Philippine government has information that Mr. Misuari has of late developed some links with the Abu Sayyaf about whom more need not be said , " he said .
Bernama quoted Malaysian police chief Norian Mai as saying police would try to hand Misuari and his men over to the Philippine government as soon as possible .
Tiglao said he had been informed that Misuari was taken to the Sabah state capital of Kota Kinabalu .
He expressed the government 's determination to put Misuari in jail .
" Definitely , " he said .
" We have to enforce the law . "
Elaborating on the 'axis of evil '
PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush 's National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has recently " defined " the context and scope of the term " axis of evil " that Bush used in his State of the Union address a few weeks ago to describe Iraq , Iran and North Korea .
The criteria set by Rice are the following : the three countries in question are repressive and grave human rights violators , and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction .
By all conservative estimates , there are scores of other countries which can easily qualify as repressive and violating human rights .
The rule , as far as human rights are concerned , is that every nation which does not enjoy pluralistic democracy is violating human rights and is therefore oppressive .
There are many countries in the world that hardly qualify as pluralistic democracies .
On this count , the national security adviser may have erred .
As for her wording regarding acquisition of weapons , what is particularly noteworthy is the use of the words " aggressively seeking " nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .
In other words , countries which are seeking or developing such arsenal at a slow pace do not seem to come within the scope of the " axis of evil " .
One can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another .
All other countries which are seemingly refraining from acquiring such weapons are doing so not so much to escape being branded as " evil " but rather because they have neither the knowledge nor the money to join the " nuclear club " .
Come to think of it , acquiring weapons of mass destruction per se may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is good or evil .
The mere development or possession of mass destruction weapons is not in itself a reason to label a state as evildoer .
After all , the US is the first nation to have developed nuclear weapons .
Moreover , the US is the first and only nation ever to deploy such weapons .
Perhaps the real criterion in this context is whether the nuclear country is democratic in every sense of the word .
Washington seems to be particularly disturbed and feel that its own national security is being threatened only when the nations which acquire mass destruction weapons are authoritarian or repressive , irrespective of the pace of amassing weaponry .
This is , in fact , the fear of all countries , as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction .
If this is the case , Rice could have elaborated more precise criteria for membership in the " axis of evil , " by establishing more clearly the connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction .
During the past weeks Europe and America witnessed the arrangement of important international conferences , which could on the one hand guarantee the peace and stability of the world , or could instead deteriorate the conditions .
The conference in New York , which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms , and the Genoa Conference which had a much wider and extended agenda , had two common features between them .
The first was that large and numerous bodies of dissidents were opposing the wishes and interests of a small but powerful group .
The second feature was that both conferences ended without effective result , and the decisions taken and resolutions adopted there lacked conclusiveness and were not operational .
The Bonn Conference however , which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate , could be appraised as an exception and a relative success .
After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference , it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants , who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry .
But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries ; rather , the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group .
The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [ of America ] .
American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale , possession , and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [ as published ] of American citizens , and equal to reducing their margin of security .
This is while possessing arms for self-defense is itself a factor that breeds insecurity .
Critics of the meeting , on the margin of the conference , up held the view that the American government , instead of heeding the wishes of international community , and protecting the security of world nations , and above all the safety of its own citizens , has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military-industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments .
( It should be noted that the issues moved at the conference were declared unofficial and lacking validity [ legal force ] even for the participating countries . )
[ Sentences are as published ] The most important of the three conferences , which subsequently gained even more prominence , was the conference in Genova ; perhaps even more so for the results " not obtained " at the conference , and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting .
The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda , including : economic globalization , the anti-missile shield defense project , the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection , the political and military crises in the Middle East , the Balkans , and Afghanistan , moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries , and ... [ as published ] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues , but unexpected events left all that in limbo and uncertainty .
The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of economic globalization , who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty .
When Italian police intervened and roughly handled the demonstrations , things got out of hand ; the already volatile situation reached boiling point , violent clashes broke out , and the killing of one protestor overshadowed all other issues .
The whole incident was in fact unprecedented in the history of European democracies , and has prompted a whole range of controversies and debates .
It can safely be claimed that the events in Genoa have influenced [ overshadowed ] the very conferences in New York and Bonn ; whereas , from the onset , the weak results of Genoa was foreseeable for most observers .
Because , from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization , the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries .
Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too , neither Russia , China , Japan , nor even the European Union , had shown any enthusiasm ; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project .
Concerning the environmental protection issue , the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases , and warming up of the planet earth 's climate too , which was somehow related to the [ agenda of ] Bonn Conference , America had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [ as published ] [ controversial ] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol .
Whereas , beforehand , it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at Genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the Bonn conference as well .
Even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the Middle East crisis has given rise to fierce competition between America , European Union , and Russia and China .
And it is likely that until each party seeks its own particular interest in the conflict , and until the rivalry persists , the question would continue to remain unresolved .
What , however , was most remarkable in the conferences in New York and Genoa , was the fact that most decisions made , were based on interests and tastes of particular groups [ lobbies ] .
Here are the views expressed by two of the prominent characters attending the Genoa Conference .
Jacques Chirac , the French President , responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization , had said : " They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor ... "
Similarly , Gerhard Schroeder , the German Chancellor , too had claimed that the participants at the summit meeting were the true , legitimate , and elected representatives of the people of their countries .
In the remarks made by these political leaders , one point is interesting and calls for reflection : if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations , while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them , then it must be said that they are only the elected [ leaders ] of their own nation [ people ] , and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide !
[ Exclamation mark as published ] In view of the criticisms , which have been made , they could perhaps be also considered to be the representative of powerful corporations that have placed the whole " world economy " under their influence , and as a result of that they are also controlling the world of politics globally .
At the Bonn Conference too , the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind .
The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide -- - in regard to protection of environment , and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases -- - , which has isolated America in an undeniable way .
It was due to this isolation that America , in spite of discrediting [ undermining ] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [ resolution ] , was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution .
To recap , if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of New York and Genoa questions regarding : promotion of world security , improvement of economic conditions , defusing regional and global crises and conflicts , checking unleashed competition for rearmament , reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries , and ... could be addressed and appropriate , serious , and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted , the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely .
As regards the recent conference ( Bonn Meeting ) , although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences , nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious , one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts , and implementation of the agreements , even though they are not protected by any sanctions .

Oshkosh Truck Corp .
Oshkosh , Wis .
estimated earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept .
fell 50 % to 75 % below the year-earlier $ 4.5 million , or 51 cents a share .
The truck maker said the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year .
In fiscal 1988 , the company earned $ 17.3 million , or $ 1.92 a share , on revenue of $ 352.9 million .
Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division , a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations .
The company said it is in the process of phasing out John Deere , its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis .
In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory , the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period .
Harare , March 14 ( XINHUA ) -- Despite the shortcomings of incumbent President Robert Mugabe 's rule which has seen Zimbabwe 's economic decline in recent years , the 78-year-old leader has carried off the palm in the country 's closest-fought presidential election since independence 22 years ago .
The nationwide polling results , released by the country 's electoral authorities Wednesday , gave Mugabe of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front ( ZANU-PF ) 1,685 , 212 votes , or 56 percent , against his closest rival , Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , with 1 , 258,401 votes , or 41.7 percent .
" I am 77 years old , but I am still going strong .
My fist carries a force , which can make one tumble and roll over 77 times , " Mugabe boasted in a recent rally .
After defending his " crown " to his last-ditch efforts , the veteran statesman , who bragged him a " young old man " with abundant reserves of energy to continue ruling Zimbabwe , has finally won the political boxing match against Tsvangirai , a more youthful opponent , who celebrated his 50th birthday on Sunday .
Analysts said Mugabe , the last of the old African nationalists who rode to power on the colonial winds of change , has won on the strength of the appeal of ZANU-PF 's land policy , under which the government was seizing idle farms from white farmers , who own the bulk of the country 's arable land , to resettle landless peasants .
They said the re-elected president received much of his votes from the rural areas , where voter turnout was considered much higher than that in towns and cities .
Their comments were echoed by rural voters , who said the majority of them , who voted for ZANU-PF , were voting for land , and they will get it .
" People in the rural areas support the ruling party because our party has been genuine on its policy on land reform .
The government has been giving us land and that will win us votes , " said Kudakwashe Mapfumo , whose family was among the first beneficiaries of the land reform .
" We were given a piece of land which my parents have been able to farm and provide us with food , " said Mapfumo , a ZANU-PF activist .
Analysts said another reason for Mugabe to win the poll is his wise campaign strategy .
Mugabe , whose strongholds are in the countryside , took election campaign to urban areas , where Tsvangirai enjoyed much support among those urban workers .
While depending heavily on his rural support , Mugabe told thousands of urbanizers he would focus on housing and job creation if re-elected .
" We want to come up with policies that will result in the creation of more jobs for the youths and those leaving school and colleges .
The issue of good housing and similar services is also a top priority of the government , " Mugabe said in a recent rally held in the capital Harare , the biggest political fortress for the MDC party .
Of the 1,685,212 votes Mugabe garnered , there are some more votes coming from towns and cities , which were boosting his lead in the crucial poll .
Despite the economic hardships and food shortages currently experienced by Zimbabweans , analysts said there are other major achievements Mugabe 's government is credited for .
During Mugabe 's 22-year-rule , the country used to boast of having a good education system and a good health system , which was to some extent affected by the lackluster economy .
However , a large number of middle-aged people , who benefited from Mugabe 's reign , are still nostalgic about the lost time and voted for him with a strong hope for economic revival .
Although some things have gone wrong under ZANU-PF leadership , Zimbabweans still chose Mugabe , the political strong man , because they said they were lured by his Millennium Economic Recovery Program .
Under his blueprint , the government hopes to stabilize the economy through curtailing state expenditure , reforming public enterprises and expanding agriculture .
Regular British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban , Robin Cook signalled tonight .
His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz .
SAS [ Special Air Service ] soldiers and their American counterparts are fighting alongside the Alliance as they have swept across large swathes Afghanistan .
But Commons Leader Mr Cook said : " If you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put British troops into the ground civil war and I do n't myself imagine that 's going to change . "
British troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was " better than anybody could have hoped for " , according to Mr Cook .
" We will continue obviously to keep the situation under review , but frankly , I think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in Afghanistan .
This is not a reverse , it 's actually an advance , " he added .
News of the Kandahar negotiations came after the Taliban control crumbled in their final northern stronghold of Kunduz following mass surrender .
The city 's top Taliban commander was among thousands of Afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting .
However , night fell before the Alliance could secure the city , increasing the danger of militants fighting back .
Hours after the vanguard entered from the west , a tank column halted its advance from the east , fearing hostile fire .
The surrender took days to hammer out , primarily because hard core Taliban and foreign troops from Usama Bin Ladin 's al-Qa'ida terror network did not want to give up .
The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban 's last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country .
Hundreds of foreign fighters captured in the siege of the northern city were killed in a prison riot at a fortress outside Mazar-e-Sharif , the Northern Alliance said .
But that did not stop Taliban commanders discussing the surrender of Kandahar , following calls from 70 Afghan tribal leaders for them to avert bloodshed .
" There are some talks and negotiations going on there ( in Kandahar ) with the Taliban to surrender themselves , " Gen Mohammed Zaer Azimi said in Herat .
Ruud Lubbers , the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees , said Afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in and " not enough " food had been taken into the country .
" It is not at all a secure environment , " he told the programme .
" So although our international staff went back to Kabul and hope to go back to the other places ... one can not say it is safe in the country and secure enough .
" So there is quite a job to be done in creating a secure environment for humanitarian assistance . "
His concerns echoed those voiced by leading charity Oxfam , which said instability across the country was hampering aid efforts .
But the Prime Minister 's official spokesman today said Tony Blair was pleased with the progress that had been made on the military , diplomatic and humanitarian fronts .
" The situation obviously remains fluid from hour to hour but it seems to be going in the right direction , " the spokesman said .
The campaign so far showed Alliance military success was the best way of getting food in , he said .
He again stressed that Britain would need to see evidence before it became involved in military action in other countries .
" In terms of the war on terrorism we have always said this is a multi-faceted campaign but equally we have also said any future military action would have to be based on evidence , " he said .
" This campaign is not over .
We are still in the middle of fighting the war in Afghanistan . "
( CORR ) Spanish premier , EU leader urge Russia to ratify Kyoto Protocol
Barcelona , 14 March : The current president of the EU , Jose Maria Aznar , and the president of the European Commission , Romano Prodi , have sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they urge him to promote the ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change .
In the letter , to which Efe has had access , Aznar and Prodi explain that on 4 March the council of EU environment ministers agreed the adoption of a decision for approval of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on behalf of the European Community .
They explain that this agreement is an important step for the EU in fulfilling the political pledge to achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development .
To this end , Aznar and Prodi report that only the internal ratification processes in each of the member states have now to be concluded and they emphasize that these are at an advanced stage and in some cases have been completed .
" Therefore , we have complete confidence that the instruments of ratification of the European Community and of the 15 member states will be able to be lodged with the Secretariat of the United Nations within the time scale anticipated , in other words , in early June of this year , " they add .
However , the letter emphasizes that for the Kyoto Protocol to be able to enter into force in the near future it is not enough for EU ratification to be guaranteed and they thus urge Putin to ensure that Russia also moves ahead with ratification .
They make this request " convinced of the Russian Federation 's resolute commitment to the Kyoto Protocol " and believing that in this manner the EU and Russia would continue to show the " leadership " which they believe they have shared " with such fruitful results , in international cooperation in the fight against climate change " .
Beijing , April 9 ( XINHUA ) -- The Taiwan issue is purely China 's internal affair and no other country in the world should interfere , Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said in response to claims from a high-ranking US military official that the US would do everything needed to protect Taiwan .
The remarks seriously violated the commitments made by the US government in the three Sino-US Joint Communiques , said Zhang , adding that those remarks , out of ulterior motives , interfered in China 's internal affairs .
Zhang stressed that history had repeatedly proved that US arms sales to Taiwan and its elevation US-Taiwan relations would only incite the separatists in their attempts to split Taiwan from mainland and would lead to the deterioration of Taiwan Straits situation and boiled down to the jeopardy of the interests of the US itself .
The spokeswoman urged the US to strictly abide by the serious commitments that it had made to the Chinese government and Chinese people and stop the wrong actions so as to avoid further damage to Sino-US relations .
The Taiwan issue was at the core of Sino-US relations , reiterated Zhang , emphasizing that any measures or remarks that ran against the three Sino-US Joint Communiques would undermine Sino-US relations .
" We hope US behaves as it says , strictly abide by the three Sino-US Communiques and stop using the Taiwan issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs , " Zhang said .
At a Japan-US summit meeting on 18 February , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi expressed some understanding of US President George W. Bush 's remarks that Iran , Iraq , and the DPRK ( North Korea ) are an " axis of evil . "
This left the impression that Japan stands alone on this issue because European countries have been cool to Bush 's " axis of evil " rhetoric .
However , it will be difficult for Japan to provide support to the US , as it did when the US attacked Afghanistan , if US forces launch military action against Iraq .
It can be said that the Japanese Government has put itself in a difficult position .
At a meeting of several officials held at the outset of the summit , the President first took up economic issues and then referred to his " axis of evil " remark .
He urged Japan to follow the US by saying : " The international community needs to cooperate to change Iran , Iraq , and North Korea 's action pattern ( of spreading weapons of mass destruction ) .
All options ( including military action ) are on the table . "
European countries are critical of Bush 's " axis of evil " remark .
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine criticized the remark as " simplistic interpretation of the world . "
However , Koizumi said , " I take the remark as the indication of the President 's strong resolve to fight terrorism . "
The US has repeatedly suggested the possibility of its taking military action against the government of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn .
It is possible that if the US military attack Iraq , Japan , which has shown understanding of the axis of evil remark , will be asked to provide active support to the US as it did during US attacks on Afghanistan .
However , it will be difficult for the Self-Defense Forces to provide logistic support to US forces attacking Iraq under a special antiterrorism law aimed at eradicating terrorism , which was enacted after terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September .
" It is also politically very difficult " to enact a new law considering the declining support for the Koizumi Cabinet , said a source within the Prime Minister 's Official Residence .
If Japan does not give any support to possible US attacks on Iraq despite its understanding of the axis of evil rhetoric , Bush 's expectations on the Koizumi administration will certainly change to disappointment .
Although the Japanese Government has expressed understanding of Bush 's axis of evil remark , it does not hope to see the US taking military action .
Because of this , Koizumi noted the need for the international community to cooperate in tackling Iraqi issues and enthusiastically asked Bush to not take the bold course of launching military action .
In reply , the President said , " We want to resolve all issues peacefully , and we intend to continue diplomatic efforts. " However , it is unclear whether Japan can actually prevent the US from taking military action .

HARARE -- Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from some areas of the drought-ravaged country as punishment for not voting the correct way in March 's election .
Mr. Tsvangirai , the 50-year-old leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , alleged in an interview that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution the ruling ZANU-PF has waged against him and his supporters .
He also spoke about the support his country 's opposition movement has received from abroad , and his pending trial on treason charges , both issues with Canadian connections .
But he focused on the violence and hunger that have plagued many Zimbabweans since the controversial presidential election , at least in part a state-orchestrated operation aimed at crushing the opposition , he said .
" I feel very strongly for these people , " Mr. Tsvangirai said .
" This is just the pursuance of a vendetta .
The situation has escalated wildly since the election .
It 's part of Mugabe 's grand strategy to target the MDC 's supporter base . "
He said the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe , where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest .
" The first targets are the farmers and their workers , then rural-area sympathizers , " he said .
The United Nations World Food Program warned last week that as many as 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation from the drought , compounded by government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms that have crippled production of maize and wheat .
Ground corn , known locally as " mealie meal , " is the staple diet of millions of Zimbabweans who can afford little else .
Mr. Mugabe acknowledged the country 's agricultural problems last week , declaring a " state of disaster " brought on by drought and sabotage by white farmers .
He made no reference to the economic upheaval caused by the farm invasions , but the government says it is trying to import supplies from South Africa , China , Argentina and Brazil .
Because of restrictions on foreign reporters in Zimbabwe , it was impossible to obtain direct government comment on Mr. Tsvangirai 's allegations .
But non-governmental organizations operating in the country also said they have been seeing evidence of discriminatory food distribution .
" Food is now a major issue , " said Shari Eppel of Amani Trust , a human-rights organization .
" . . . We have come across cases of people having to have a ZANU-PF card before they are allowed to buy from the Grain Marketing Board , " which is the body that controls imports and sales .
In the southwestern region of Matabeleland , for example , cases have been reported where people had to go through a " cleansing " routine to purge them of their MDC sympathies before being allowed to buy corn .
" According to reports we have received , they are taken to the police to denounce the MDC , then to the war veterans , where they go through a public confession , " Mrs. Eppel said .
" Then they are taken to the local headman to be kept under observation .
After a few days , he decides if they can be allowed to buy grain from the GMB . "
Meanwhile , Mr. Tsvangirai alleged , the land-reform plan , nominally launched to resettle one million poor families , is actually putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite .
He said beneficiaries of the program have included government ministers , MPs , army and police officials -- even Mr. Mugabe 's in-laws .
" The situation we see now is what I call the Last Supper -- it is ZANU-PF 's final feast , " Mr. Tsvangirai said .
" It is a case of take what you can while you can. "
The opposition leader commended Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mr. Mugabe 's regime .
But he said Zimbabwe 's future rests largely with its own people .
" The international community can support us so far , but it can never remove the shackles of repression , " he said .
" The burden really lies with Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom . "
He said the violence , hunger and economic turmoil are strengthening his country 's appetite for a public campaign for change .
" There is no struggle without casualties , but we do n't want to engineer any reckless action , " he cautioned .
" . . . A systematic , strategic program of mass mobilization is necessary to confront a stolen victory and an illegitimate government . "
Mr. Tsvangirai also touched on his own legal battle with the government : On May 31 , he is to stand trial on a charge of treason , accused of plotting to have Mr. Mugabe assassinated .
The opposition leader has denied the charge all along , and although he was reluctant to go into depth about a case still before the courts , he did make brief reference to the prosecution 's star witness , Montreal-based consultant and former Israeli intelligence agent Ari Ben-Menashe , who may or may not travel to Zimbabwe for the trial .
" If the prosecution 's key witness is reluctant to testify , how will they proceed ?
" Mr. Tsvangirai asked .
" There is no case to answer . "
U.S. Begins First Airlift of Prisoners
WASHINGTON , Jan. 10 - A C-17 Globemaster cargo plane carrying 20 heavily guarded Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners left a Marine Corps base in southern Afghanistan today on its way to the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , the first wave of hundreds of detainees who will be held there .
The Pentagon provided few details about the flight , but senior military officials said more than 40 specially trained military police officers guarded the prisoners on the flight , which was expected to make one stop before reaching Cuba , possibly as early as Friday morning .
The prisoners , their hands and feet shackled and their heads covered by hoods , were loaded single file onto the plane at Kandahar Airport .
Pentagon officials said some prisoners might also be sedated during the more-than-20-hour flight , but it was not clear whether that had happened .
A Pentagon official said earlier this week that the United States did not consider the detainees prisoners of war , but that they were still being afforded the protections under the Geneva Convention guidelines .
At Guantanamo Bay , the prisoners will be taken to a makeshift detention center known as Camp X- Ray , where they will be locked in 6- by-8-foot cages made of concrete and chain-link fence to await intensive interrogation and , possibly , trial before military tribunals .
As workers prepared the camp in Cuba for as many as 2,000 prisoners , search crews in Pakistan continued to comb the wreckage of a Marine Corps tanker plane that crashed on Wednesday in southwestern Pakistan .
Seven marines died in the fiery accident .
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that there was no evidence that the crash had been caused by hostile fire .
Pentagon officials also said today that the United States was preparing to send a force of more than 100 soldiers , many of them Special Operations forces , to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group .
Though the American forces are expected to be involved initially in advising and training Filipino counterterrorist units , senior American military officials have said they could become involved in direct military action if the Philippine government requested it .
Amnesty International issued a statement today saying that sedating prisoners or shackling them for an entire flight would violate international standards prohibiting " cruel , inhuman or degrading " treatment .
Mr. Rumsfeld said today that he did not know how the prisoners would be restrained during the flight .
But he defended the use of strong measures , saying the Pentagon had closely studied violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners held in the northern Afghan city of Mazar- i-Sharif and in Pakistan .
About 20 minutes after the C-17 lifted off from the base at Kandahar Airport , marines came under small- arms fire near one of the runways .
No one was injured and the identify of the snipers remained unknown tonight , military officials said .
Military officials also said John Walker Lindh , the American who was captured with Taliban forces near Mazar-i-Sharif , was not among the prisoners transferred today .
Mr. Walker is still being held aboard the assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea , the officials said .
American forces in Afghanistan were holding a total of 371 prisoners today , including 351 at Kandahar and 19 at Bagram air base north of Kabul .
But the number keeps rising as American military and intelligence officials continue interviewing thousands of prisoners held by anti-Taliban militias .
Camp X-Ray has cells for about 100 detainees , and will soon be expanded to hold 220 .
During the next few months , military work crews will build permanent facilities for as many as 2,000 prisoners .
Mr. Rumsfeld declined to discuss details about the growing American involvement in the Philippines , where Abu Sayyaf guerrillas have been battling government troops in the southern island of Basilan .
The rebels , who have been linked to Al Qaeda in the past , are holding two American hostages for ransom .
But earlier this week , Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz said that American Special Operations forces might become involved in " direct support of Philippine military operations , " though he added that the government seemed " anxious " to do the job itself .
" There 's no question that we believe that if they could clear the Abu Sayyaf group out of Basilan Island , that would be a small blow against the extended Al Qaeda network , " Mr. Wolfowitz said .
In November , President Bush promised to give the Philippines a $ 100 million antiterrorism aid package that would include weapons , training and shared intelligence .
Since then , the United States has sent an array of equipment to the Philippine military , including a C-130 cargo plane , 30,000 M-16 rifles and 8 UH- 1 Huey helicopters .
In eastern Afghanistan , American B-1 and B-52 bombers dropped precision-guided weapons on the sprawling Al Qaeda training camp at Zhawar Kili near the Pakistan border today for the sixth time in just over a week .
Senior military officials have said they are increasingly concerned that there are other equally sophisticated and well-fortified underground complexes elsewhere in Afghanistan that could become guerrilla bases for remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces .
At the Pentagon , Mr. Bush signed a $ 318 billion military spending bill today for the 2002 fiscal year .
" Today more than ever we also owe those in uniform the resources they need to maintain a very high state of readiness , " Mr. Bush said .
" Our enemies rely upon surprise and deception .
They used to rely upon the fact that they thought we were soft .
I do n't think they think that way anymore . "

Cornell Each year , we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles .
Their one common goal : they all want to work .
A robust economy helps by providing job opportunities , but to be honest , most of the people who are n't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest obstacles .
The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like health care , transportation and child care -problems that are big enough on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental disabilities , illiteracy and lack of job skills .
Last year , Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their self-sufficiency .
Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support services that will help even more find jobs .
Right now , there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels like to support themselves .
You can help them to know that feeling .
Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs .
Use the enclosed card and give a generous gift to Goodwill today !

March 17 , 2000 Name Address City , ST , Zip Dear Name : When Jerry was released from prison , he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life .
He knew he had made a bad mistake , but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life , he just did n't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path .
Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street .
He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live .
The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill 's Career Academy staff for job search assistance .
Jerry 's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately .
But Jerry's troubles did n't end there .
The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended , and he returned to Career Academy for help once more .
Unemployed , homeless and with a prison record , Jerry now faced going back to prison for failure to pay child support .
It took some time and hard work , but with the help of Goodwill , Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor 's office , find housing and conduct a more thorough job search .
With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana , many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment .
Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999 , over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job .
Some , like Jerry , are ex-offenders .
Some are blind , deaf or have other physical disabilities .
More than 100 were homeless .
But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome , like Jerry .
With a promising new job at a plastic injection molding manufacturer , his legal troubles in check and a safe place to live , Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself and contributing to his community .
For as long as he needs it , Goodwill will continue to help .
Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful employment .
And , with your assistance , Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job .
Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending a gift to Goodwill .
Your generosity will help people help themselves .
Sincerely , James M. McClelland President
Annan welcomes restitution of constitution in Venezuela
Tehran , April 16 , IRNA -- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan telephoned Hugo Chavez , President of Venezuela on April 15 to express satisfaction that the process of restoring constitutional order in Venezuela was underway .
According to UN Information Center in Tehran , he appealed for national reconciliation and underscored the importance of an inclusive democratic system in the country .
In response , President Chavez reiterated his commitment to the principles of constitutional rule , legality and democracy and his determination to pursue a broad-based national dialogue .
The Secretary-General welcomed the return of calm to the country , and noted his readiness to assist in the effort to strengthen the democratic dialogue , the rule of law and human rights in Venezuela .
a brief History Prehistoric man in Asia Minor ( now modern Turkey ) or Greece could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint silhouette of land .
Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands , marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring .
Around 7000 b.c. , the Phoenicians set out from what is now Iran to explore their surroundings .
They eventually reached the islands , and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part of the Aegean Sea .
An important early material , obsidian , was discovered on the island of Milos .
Obsidian is a hard , vitreous volcanic rock , which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and stabbing .
The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area remained popular with early travelers .
The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come together as early as 5000 b.c. , and were already in place by the late Bronze Age ( c. 2700 b.c. ) .
The major changes were not to daily tasks and routines , but to the political power base , which changed regularly and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages .
Cycladic Culture
At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands .
The distinctive , sculpted marble figures of the era are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs .
You will find original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the Cyclades , although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on Paros .
The people farmed and fished ; on the dawning of the Bronze Age in 2700 b.c .
they began to work with metals .
The Cycladic culture was influenced by societies in the east , importing the pottery wheel from Mesopotamia .
They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local marble .
The Minoans and the Myceneans
Farther south in Crete , the Minoan culture developed after 2000 b.c. into the most significant of its age , spreading its influence throughout the region by trade and diplomacy .
Santorini ( Thira ) , the next major island north , was heavily influenced by Crete , and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time .
The magnificent frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present , but the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the sophistication of the culture here .
Around 1500 b.c .
a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini destroyed not only Akrotiri -- under feet of ash and pumice -- but the whole Minoan civilization .
Massive tidal waves swept over Crete , and other parts of the Mediterranean , smashing buildings and drowning many thousands of people .
In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval , the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans ( at around 1300 b.c .
who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland .
The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer , not to trade .
Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad .
The Rise of Athens The Dorians , who came overland from northern Europe , conquered the Mycenaeans .
They were a barbaric race , and their custody of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art disappeared .
They held sway over islands off the northern Greek coast , but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea routes ; south of the area , trade continued as usual .
At the same time , city-states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland .
Athens became the most powerful , heralding the start of the classical Greek period .
However , Greece was not yet a country ; each city-state was self-governing and autonomous .
The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean , helped by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements such as Carthage , a Greek city on the African coast of the Mediterranean .
Culture and the arts flourished once again .
Athletic prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in 776 b.c. , to promote friendly competition .
Homer wrote his epic works on Chios ; and lyrical poetry was much admired , particularly the work of the poets Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos .
The preeminent islands of this era were Delos , a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens ; Samos , ruled by the tyrant Polycrates ; and Naxos , whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects .
Archaeology shows that , during this time , societies lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement inland .
The Persian Wars As Athens rose in influence and power in the West , it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire .
From a power base in Anatolia , the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and set their sights on the Cyclades .
In 490 b.c. , they captured sacred Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos .
The island communities were undecided about which side to back for a time .
Paros and Andros contributed to the Persian armory , while others supported Athens .
The two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and Salamis in 480 b.c .
The Persians were defeated , and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it .
Following its victory , Athens introduced the concept of a mutual protection alliance ( a kind of NATO of the ancient world ) .
Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together , and created a treasury to fund their plans , which was held on the island of Delos .
The alliance became known as the Delian League .
Although there were minor internal wrangles , the league controlled the Aegean and the greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b.c .
Later , in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age .
In 431 b.c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and league member Sparta .
Although the islands saw little action , as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power .
Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors , who were led by Philip II of Macedon .
He was followed in 336 b.c. by his son Alexander the Great , one of the most remarkable leaders in history .
His rise to power ushered in the Hellenistic period .
Hellenistic and Roman Periods When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east as India , the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes .
Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire .
Following Alexander ' s death , his lands were divided among his generals .
Much of the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies , along with Egypt .
Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan .
Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands , the next major power change brought influence from the West .
The Greek Hellenistic Empire was gradually , and peacefully , absorbed into the Roman Empire .
The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity The Romans ruled a pagan empire , but the Aegean had an important influence on the early development of Christianity .
In a.d. 95 , St. John arrived on Patmos , a small rocky island in the Dodecanese , as a political prisoner .
It was here that he wrote what was to become the final book of the New Testament , the Book of Revelation .
It wasn ' t until a.d. 330 , however , when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium , renamed Constantinople , capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life .
The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities , but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders .
In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen Muslims , a new potent religious force from the East , the Byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands .
Disease took a further toll .
By the time of the Crusades , many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated .
As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first millennium , Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith .
Unfortunately , their zeal was not matched by their discrimination .
The crusaders swept through the l ; and of Byzantium slaughtering Christians as well as Muslims , civilians as well as soldiers .
Constantinople was taken by Crusader forces in 1204 , and they stripped the city of manyof its finest treasures -- which now grace the public buildings of Venice -- although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell .
While Byzantine land was being divided , there was no one in control of the seas , so pirates raided towns on many of the islands .
To counter this , the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland , out of sight of the raiding parties .
This created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port ( skala ) which serves an inland settlement or chora , making it easier to protect the island from attack .
The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen , many of whom were Genoese or Venetian , such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos .
The noblemen had free rein to create their own fiefdoms .
The Venetians fortified their main towns -- Naxos Town and Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this -- creating labyrinths of narrow alleys and cul-de-sacs that were designed to confuse and to demoralize invaders .
The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands , which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade .
After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309 , Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land .
The Knights of St. John , a holy military force , made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the Dodecanese .
They began the process of building their strong citadels , and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands .
However , they had not seen the last of their Muslim foe .
A force was gaining strength in the east to threaten their new bases .
The Coming of the Ottoman Turks The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east , taking land in what is now Turkey .
By the end of the 13th century , they began their first raids on the Aegean Islands .
In 1453 , they took Constantinople , and immediately made it their capital , renaming it Istanbul .
They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of St. John and , after an unsuccessful siege in 1480 , they finally ejected the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522 .
In 1566 , they wrested Chios from the Genoese , bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands , but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or more -- Tinos was the last to fall in 1715 .
The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled , forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean .
Toward Greek Independence However , a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state .
In 1770 , Russia came to aid the Greeks ( defined by their Orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries ) , declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774 .
Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of Antiparos .
Although this attempt was unsuccessful , the campaign for a Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in strength .
The Aegean Islands played their part .
Lesvos , Chios , and Samos lay in the important shipping lanes , and patriots began disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic .
In return , the Turks violently put down every insurrection , including the massacre on Chios , when 22,000 people were slaughtered .
The Ottoman Empire was weakening , however , and in 1821 , the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time .
The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state .
A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout the Aegean , thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the disparate Orthodox populations .
The Twentieth Century A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the 20th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire .
The Turks lost a short war with Italy , and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians .
Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories .
Following this debacle , the Ottomans then allied themselves to Germany in the World War I , losing more territory with the defeat of the Germans in that war .
Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor , which for over 2,000 years had had a substantial Greek population .
Greece moved in to administer the land , but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater Greece .
In 1923 , Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers , and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support .
He promised a modern state for his people , but as the situation became volatile , civil strife broke out in Turkish cities , and those considered Greek were victims of threats and violence .
Many had to leave their birthplaces , fleeing to Lesvos , Chios , and Samos , the Greek-ruled islands just offshore .
Thousands of people arrived with little more than the clothes they wore , putting great strain on the resources of the islands .
Finally , Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor , which became part of the new Turkish state .
Greece attempted to stay out of World War II , but Mussolini saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire .
His forces made a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands , including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town , but they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population against them .
Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the islands .
After the war , in 1949 , the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation .
But the country was politically fragmented , with arguments between monarchists and republicans , right and left , and tension escalated into civil war .
The struggle bypassed most of the islands , although there was fierce fighting on Samos .
Even after the fighting stopped more than a decade later , the country was not stable .
At the same time , the massive growth in air and road transport saw shipping decline in importance .
The Aegean Islands , which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes , became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse .
In 1967 , the military took the reins of power in Athens , and until 1974 , the `` Colonels '' held sway with a repressive and brutal regime .
Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror , and many made new homes in the United States and Australia .
The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism , and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp , cool summers .
In 1982 , Greece joined the European Common Market ( now the European Union ) .
Since this time , membership has been of great monetary benefit to the country .
The EU has given large subsidies to develop Greece ' s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient monuments .
Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands , and road systems have been expanded and im proved .
Private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible .
Politically , the 1990s have been relatively quite times for the islands , although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused consternation within conservative Greek society .
As the Balkans flared to war once again , Greek nationalism has stirred , and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers .
Whether this will ever happen remains to be seen , but perhaps the aid offered by Greece to Turkey after 1999 ' s devastating earthquake is a sign that the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to diminish .
Australia 's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island , located just a stone 's throw , a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta , has concerned some in the Indonesian Government .
Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made , the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia .
The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad , work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002 , with launches beginning from 2004 .
The problem is , this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket , fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory , but will also disrupt flights and shipping .
If a rocket launch fails , debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely-populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali , and on to the east as far as Timor .
The memory Russia 's Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of .
Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station , which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes , burned up as it re-entered the earth 's atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia .
Nevertheless , intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean .
Prior to that , two Soviet satellites struck the earth .
Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954 , which contained radioactive substances , crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977 .
Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia 's national sovereignty .
At such close proximity , if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse , firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy .
On the other hand , Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit ( GSO ) .
Notwithstanding the above , in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou , San Marco and Sriharikota .
But the famous US space centre , the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator .
Therefore , plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia 's objections .
International law governing accountability if one nation 's space debris falls on another is already in existence .
The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects , 28 March 1972 , known as the 1972 Liability Convention .
The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state , either jointly or collectively , for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth 's atmosphere .
The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states ' space projects .
As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port , Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention , Section 14 .
This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission , which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state ( in this case Australia ) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state .
Of course , lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one 's hands .
Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space .
These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 ( Space Treaty 1967 ) , the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 ( Liability Convention 1972 ) , and finally , the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 ( Registration Convention 1974 ) .
So far , the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention .
This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory .
Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle , the Absolute Liability principle .
This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim .
It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching .
A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia , as a state that has suffered damage , were to lodge a damages claim .
In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station , Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station .
This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission .
But in conversation with Kompas on Sunday ( 17 Mar ) , one of Indonesia 's few space law experts , Prof Dr Priyatna Abdurrasyid , expressed a different opinion .
Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim , he said .
It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre .
" If Australia then denies the claim , we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities .
If a deadlock in negotiations occurs , the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator .
This is no different to arbitration hearings to resolve other cases , " Priyatna said .
Unfortunately , historical precedent shows that claiming compensation is no easy matter .
In claiming compensation from the Soviet Union over Cosmos 954 , Canada was forced to navigate numerous procedural complications .
This is a very important lesson for Indonesia .
Unlike other experts , Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [ about the Australian planned space station ] .
" In principle , my personal opinion is that we should n't go against the current .
Rather we should the use the current to our mutual benefit , " he said .
Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project , Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour 's space activities .
" The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities .
The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes , " Priyatna said .
The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour .
" Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre .
Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967 .
Rather than issuing a letter of objection to the Australian Government , would n't it be better to join them in our own national interest ? " he asked .
The kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on Christmas Island , and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states , and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception .
These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967 .
Australia should adhere to the Cardinal Principle of International Law , which states that all nations in the world must first respect and promote the humanitarian interests and progress of all humankind .
But the problem is , who can ensure that these guidelines will indeed be adhered to ?
Israeli Parliament Speaker Slams Zionist Occupation
TEHRAN In a rare move on Tuesday , Israeli Parliament Speaker Avraham Burg condemned the Zionist regime 's occupation of Palestinian territories .
In an interview with the Qatari Al Jazeera television network , Burg denounced the policy , much to the displeasure of Israeli officials and right-wing MPs .
He repeatedly said that the occupation of the Palestinian territories could lead to corruption in Israel and would only create scandals for the regime .
Earlier this week some 50 Israeli army officers were reported to have been on strike and refused to attack Palestinian ruled areas in protest of the occupation policies of the Zionist regime .
They said fighting for the settlers who had occupied the Palestinian lands was by no means a defensive act , and was merely part of the criminal policies of Israel .
I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century .
Actually , about two years ago , the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the 20th century .
But the Reserve Fund , America 's first money fund , was not named , nor were the creators of the money-fund concept , Harry Brown and myself .
We innovated telephone redemptions , daily dividends , total elimination of share certificates and the constant $ 1 pershare pricing , all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC .

DURBAN March 19 Sapa SA OBSERVER : ZIM ELECTIONS NOT FREE AND FAIR
Another member of the South African Observer Mission to Zimbabwe says the past weekend 's presidential election in the southern African country was not free and fair
Methodist Bishop Purity Malinga on Tuesday echoed the sentiments of South Africa 's Independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) chairwoman Brigalia Bam that Zimbabwe election did not conform to international standards .
Bam on Sunday said she believed Zimbabwe 's election was not free and fair , adding they were not in line with international standards as well as those of her organisation .
Malinga , who represented South African churches on 50-member mission , told journalists during breakfast at the Diakonia Council of Churches in Durban , that she was uncomfortable with the manner in which the team had been treated -- even before they left South Africa .
" We were also advised to be vigilant in what we say in private and in public , " Malinga said .
Each member was handed a booklet containing guidelines on Zimbabwean election laws .
" Personally I felt that one is going to be used here , but I nevertheless hoped the presence of outsiders in Zimbabwe would stop some illegal acts which may have been committed . "
The booklet was published by the Electoral Institute of South Africa , in Pretoria .
Malinga said according to the guidelines in the booklet , the election had been legitimate .
She believed that SAOM head , Dr Sam Motsuenyane had probably based his findings on the guidelines .
In a preliminary , Motsuenyane declared the Zimbabwe poll " legitimate " , adding they could , however , not be openly described as free and fair .
Malinga , who was based in southern Matabeleland near Beitbridge , said the election were characterised by -- among others -- intimidation .
" Even in the queues at polling centres there was a lot of fear and tension .
The election was run by the police and the army who carried weapons .
Under these circumstances nobody can feel free . "
She said international observers were treated with suspicion by the police .
" At one station were not allowed in and told that we had nothing to do with the Zimbabwe issue .
At another station we were ordered to stay at least 100 metres away .
Even local observers could not enter these stations , " she said .
" Many people were also unable to vote because their names were not on the voters ' role .
They were turned away in twenties , thirties and fifties . "
SAOM on Monday stopped short of declaring the Zimbabwean presidential election free and fair , but the African National Congress majority on the committee declared the poll " credible " .
The majority report , endorsed only by the ANC , said the observer mission had noted that over three million Zimbabweans had cast their votes and this substantially represented the will of the people .
The Inkatha Freedom Party , Democratic Alliance , New National Party , African Christian Democratic Party , the Pan Africanist Congress and the United Christian Democratic Party had disagreed with the ANC conclusion .
The United Democratic Movement was still undecided .
Other delegates in SAOM aligned themselves with the findings of the Southern African Development Community parliamentary forum that said the vote had not met SADC 's norms and standards .
The United States , Britain , local Zimbabwean observers , and the Commonwealth observer team also described the poll as not free and fair .
Prime Minister Hasan Abshir Farah returned to Mogadishu today [ 9 May ] , after having been away for a month to receive medical treatment .
He told journalists that he had visited the UAE , Kuwait and Bahrain where he held talks with leaders of those countries as well as Somali nationals there .
He said Somali nationals in Kuwait and Bahrain had expressed their satisfaction and support for the interim Somali government .
Speaking to Radio Dalmar on arrival at No 50 airstrip , the prime minister said his health was now good and that he would soon resume his national duty .
JAKARTA ( Agency ) : Indonesia and Singapore have agreed to settle their differences quietly following a row over claims by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew that terrorist leaders are at large in Indonesia , Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said as quoted by AFP Tuesday .
" The two governments have actually reached an agreement not to settle their dispute openly , but to settle whatever had arisen from the statement by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew through official channels , " Hassan told reporters .
The neighboring countries have several mechanisms for handling disputes , he said , without elaborating .
Lee last month said leaders of regional extremist cells are still at large in Indonesia .
A Singapore government statement identified Indonesian Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir as one ofthem .
The claim sparked protests and demonstrations in Jakarta and Hassan called it " provocative " .
Singapore late last year 13 suspected members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group for allegedly plotting to blow up US targets there .
It says some of them have named Ba'asyir , who runs a Muslim boarding school in Central Java , as a leader .
Ba'asyir last week filed a 100 million dollar libel lawsuit against the Singapore government .
The cleric , who has been questioned by Indonesian police but not detained , denies any links to international terror .
But he has described Osama bin Laden , the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks on the US , as " a true Muslim fighter " .
Indonesia has come under pressure from several quarters to take tougher action against alleged terrorist leaders but has played down the threat .
Harare , March 17 ( XINHUA ) -- Despite Western pressure on him over his re-election victory , Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was sworn in on Sunday as the country 's head of state to serve another six-year term .
With a 21-gun salute sounding and four fighter jets sweeping overhead , the colorful inauguration took place amid thunderous applause by thousands of ruling party supporters .
Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku presided over the swearing-in ceremony , which was witnessed by leaders of some other African countries , including Malawian President Bakili Muluzi , Namibian President Sam Nujoma , Democratic Republic of the Congo President Joseph Kabila , Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano , Tanzanian President Benjamin Mukapa , South African Vice-President Jacob Zuma , Zambian Vice-President Enock Kavendele .
Zimbabwe 's top judge , who was dressing in British-style scarlet and black robes and shoulder-length horsehair judicial wigs , bedecked Mugabe with a red sash of office .
" I , Robert Gabriel Mugabe do swear that I will be faithful to the laws of the Republic of Zimbabwe , so help me God , " said Mugabe who was flanked by first lady Grace .
Mugabe , who is from the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front ( ZANU-PF ) , won last weekend 's presidential election by polling 1,685,212 against his closest rival Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) who polled 1,262,401 votes .
At the State House , where the ceremony was held , thousands of ZANU-PF supporters in clothing emblazoned with Mugabe 's portrait , were singing and dancing to celebrate his victory , with a hope that Mugabe will finally deliver on his promises to give them the land currently owned by the country 's white minority .
In his inauguration speech shortly after he was sworn in as president , Mugabe vowed to continue with his government 's controversial land reform program .
He told thousands of cheering supporters that " land reforms must proceed with greater speed and strength " to shore up the economy , badly battered by years of political instability .
He said the program , under which the government was taking over idle farms from white farmers , who own the bulk of Zimbabwe 's arable land , to resettle landless blacks , would form the centerpiece of his efforts to revive the economy .
" We want to make sure that blacks play a meaningful role in the economy , and we will do that through the land reforms , " said Mugabe .
In the run-up to the March 9-11 poll , critics had accused the Zimbabwean leader of stirring up the emotive land issue merely to garner support in the country 's closest-fought election since independence in 1980 .
But he told the nation that in spite of stiff opposition to the agrarian reforms from powerful Western countries , especially the country 's former colonial power of Britain , he would press ahead to seize farms from whites and resettle blacks .
" That message has not been accepted in Britain , that Zimbabwe is for Zimbabweans .
This is our land , and we have no intention of owning a piece of land in Britain , " said Mugabe .
He described his victory in the poll as " a stunning blow to imperialism " and thanked African countries for supporting Zimbabwe in its stand-off with Western countries over the agrarian reforms .
Many African leaders have supported Mugabe 's re-election victory in Zimbabwe 's crucial election , which they said was " transparent , credible , free and fair " .
Mugabe said Zimbabwe needed their continued support against what he called hostile international attention .
" When they aim at Zimbabwe , it is not Zimbabwe alone , they have other countries in mind . "
In his campaign for re-election , the Zimbabwean leader repeatedly accused Britain and its Western allies of trying to re-assert neocolonial rule in Zimbabwe , and the region , by installing a compliant opposition party in power .
" Thanks to the people , our people and the people of Africa for this joint effort in rejecting this neocolonial attempt .
Africa is for Africans , " said Mugabe .
However , Mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity , incorporating his closest rival in the poll , to ensure political and economic stability in Zimbabwe .
South African President Thabo Mbeki and President Olusegun Obasanjo are expected in Harare Monday for talks with the Zimbabwean leader on a possible government of national unity .
The two , along with Australian Prime Minister John Howard , are members of a Commonwealth panel charged with assessing the election and recommending possible action by the group against Zimbabwe .
The panel was scheduled to meet in London on Tuesday .
Diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow Britain and the United States to save face over their insistence on the MDC ' s victory in Zimbabwe 's election .
The European Union ( EU ) and the US have joined the opposition in alleging the election was neither free nor fair and threatened more sanctions on Zimbabwe .
A final communique issued on Saturday evening after the Barcelona EU summit said , " The European Union will maintain its humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe and will consider possible additional targeted measures against its government . "
Sunday 's inauguration ceremony was boycotted by EU countries , the US and some members of the Commonwealth .
Also , the opposition 's 57 members of parliament stayed away .
In his inaugural address , Mugabe extended an olive branch to the opposition to join him in rebuilding the country 's economy , which has suffered three years of consecutive decline , but did not say in what role .
" Our energy is better spent on reviving the economy than plotting to bring down each other , " he said .
" The call to all of us , whether in the ruling party or in the opposition , is that we unite and come together as one people .
There are areas where we must work together because we have a common destiny , " said Mugabe .
The MDC party rejected the voting results , claiming the government rigged the poll in favor of incumbent President Mugabe .
MDC leader Tsvangirai said pre-election violence prevented his party from campaigning in rural areas , the stronghold of the ruling party , and that thousands of his supporters in towns were disenfranchised when they failed to vote because authorities reduced polling centers in urban areas .
The ZANU-PF government denied rigging the election , saying Mugabe won on the strength of the appeal of ZANU-PF 's land policy .
Analysts said Mugabe received much of his votes from the rural areas , where voter turnout was considered much higher than in towns and cities .

JAKARTA ( JP ) : Protesting Muslim students in favor of Palestinian solidarity tried to force their way into the U.S. Embassy compound on Jl. [ Road ] Medan Merdeka Selatan in Central Jakarta on Wednesday , prompting clashes with the police officers who tried to block them away , reports said .
Some 500 protesters , among them from KAMMI ( Indonesian Muslim Student Committee ) , breached the barbed wire barricades in front of the embassy , El Shinta radio reported live from the scene around 3:50 p.m. [ 0830 GMT ] Wednesday .

Taipei , Nov. 29 ( CNA ) -- Thirty political observers from around the world are slated to participate in an international symposium on democratic consolidation , peace and security to be held in Taipei Sunday .
The experts and scholars will be divided into discussion panels that will address the significance of Taiwan 's elections and its democratic consolidation , a comparative analysis of democratic elections and Taiwan 's democracy in the Asia Pacific region .
A roundtable discussion will also take place .
According to the Government Information Office ( GIO ) , which is co-sponsoring the symposium with National Chengchi University 's Institute of International Relations , the symposium is being held to provide the world with a greater understanding of Taiwan 's role in regional stability .
The GIO added that Taiwan 's accomplishment in democratization is the " best role model " for mainland China 's progress toward democracy .
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at the symposium to explain the government 's policy toward mainland China .
Some of the visiting experts from 10 countries , including the United States , Canada , Britain , Germany , France and Japan , have been arriving since Wednesday to call on key government agencies and local political leaders ahead of Saturday 's elections for legislators , county chiefs and city mayors .
In a meeting with 25 of the scholars Thursday , Tsai said in response to a question on whether Taiwan is afraid of over-reliance on the mainland market that the island will be able to achieve balanced economic growth as long as it strikes a balance between maintaining its sovereignty , developing its economy globally and normalizing relations with the mainland .
TAIPEI , Sept 26 ( AFP ) -- Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday reiterated Taipei 's full support for the United States as Washington prepared to launch reprisals against Afghanistan .
" On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of China ( Taiwan 's official name ) , I would like to extend our full support to the George W. Bush administration in its any decision and act against terrorists , " Chen said while meeting Oregon governor John Kitzhaber .
Taiwan " would not stand idly by " because " the attacks were not only a challenge to the US but also a disruption of peace for mankind , " Chen said in a statement released by the presidential office .
" The ROC government will be with the US government firmly . "
Chen again voiced his condolences to the families of the thousands of Americans killed when hijacked planes plunged into the New York World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11 .
Chen 's remarks came as the US was massing forces to launch reprisals against Afghanistan , where the prime suspect Usama bin Laden is believed to be in hiding .
Taiwan 's Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao had vowed to back the US in fighting terrorism saying Taiwan had " no option " but to do so , despite a lack of diplomatic ties between Taipei and Washington .
Since his inauguration last year , Bush has backpedalled from his predecessor Bill Clinton 's policy of engagement with China .
In April Bush approved the biggest US arms package to Taiwan since 1992 .
Washington has remained the biggest arms supplier to Taiwan despite switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 .
US Secretary of State Colin Powell , described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush 's administration , is trying to " patch up " President Bush 's statements , especially his latest one in which he made reckless threats at the " axis of evil , " namely Iran , Iraq and North Korea .
A day after President Bush 's threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction , Secretary Powell said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that " characterizing these counties as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them . "
He added : " We are prepared to initiate a dialogue , and we want to work with our friends and allies in the world on ways of dealing with such regimes . "
These are fine words , but they do not reflect the reality , because the hard-line wing in the US administration comprising Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have the final say in running affairs at the White House , and have direct influence on President Bush .
Oddly enough , speculations swirled in Washington that Powell listened to President Bush 's speech and his threats to " the axis of evil " like any other US citizen .
He had not read the speech before President Bush delivered it , as he was supposed to do by virtue of his post .
The fact that he subsequently denied these speculations does not mean they are baseless .
At any rate , Secretary Powell 's remark about the US administration 's readiness to enter dialogue with these " evil " states and with Washington 's friends on ways of dealing with them involves some contradictions .
For he affirmed in the first speech that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until after it has accepted the return of the UN arms inspectors .
The current US administration will consult with no one , not even its closest allies , whether in Europe or its followers in the Third World , particularly in the Arab world .
The US administration has already decided to " punish " any country it believes poses a danger to the Hebrew State .
It lumped North Korea with Iran and Iraq as part of the " axis of evil " only to mislead Arabs and Muslims and to create the impression that Islam is not alone targeted .
The United States is these days ruled by an alliance between two main lobbies , the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby , which sees the world through the eyes of Ari'el Sharon and his extremist government .
We therefore have to expect the worst in the near future .
President Bush is facing a recession and an economic crisis .
He does not want to repeat his father 's mistake , being defeated in the next elections because of economic factors .
He is therefore planning to trigger wars here and there to revive the flagging arms industry .
The United States is currently run by a typical Texan mentality , which is closer to that of cowboys than to a civilized mentality that believes in dialogue and coexistence among peoples .
This mentality simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment , because international economic prosperity can be built on stability , not wars .
A catastrophe would engulf every country if the US arms industry progressed at the expense of the world 's security and stability .
have you ever got one of those calls that 's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they 're either

they 're voice activated and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything
uh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i 've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them are n't from anybody at all
what i would love to see done to stop all of this
uh-huh
we 've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted
um-hum
i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it 's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
but if they 're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i do n't even understand
so yeah i do i really feel that that 's uh an invasion of my privacy
i agree with you on that particular subject there
let me see
that 's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people
um-hum
peddling products if i wanted their products i would 've either gone to the store to bought it or i would 've called for their salesman salesman to come out
um-hum um-hum
yeah that 's true living in an apartment complex though you know you ca n't um you ca n't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i 'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there 's people coming around you know and they 're trying to sell something or or they 're from a religious organization
and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago
and um gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too it was n't even what i would consider you know a family hour it 's time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
and uh i 've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i do n't particularly care for it so i especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
now i agree with their right to um
pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
um-hum
i 'm on my turf if i want them there i 'll call for them otherwise i do n't want to know they exist
right
yeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that 's fine with me too you know as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i do n't like the way that they do it either
and and it 's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
and i do n't know i just um i just do n't particularly care for that at all and that that 's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations
and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i 've even gone so far as to put that i 've got a storm door on the front of the house and i 've put in
i do n't know how much clearer it can be it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get
yeah yeah that 's true yeah no i do n't uh i do n't have i did n't go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i do n't have a storm door but i 'm sure i could rig up something
but you know i do n't think that that would stop people i mean it 's like they they see that word and it says uh go
instead of stop
oh goodness
wonder if there 'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it 'd be harassment
oh gosh
but i consider invasion of my privacy
yeah yeah
a harassment in itself
yeah yeah yeah that 's true that 's true
hm well what else
i believe we 've pretty much summed everything up
i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else
and i ca n't remember what it was
and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door
i 'm drawing the blank
oh goodness okay is our five minutes up
uh pretty close to it well i 've enjoyed talking with you
pretty close
well it was nice talking to you too Jim
and take it easy now good night
okay thanks bye
United States President George W. Bush finally announced his country 's proposal for fighting the greenhouse effect .
Seven months after having rejected the Kyoto Protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis , detrimental to US economic interests , and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations ( like Brazil and India ) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries , Bush made public the plan that , he promised , would not have any of the defects of the Kyoto Protocol and would achieve the same , if not better , results .
Basically , the Bush plan makes the reduction in pollution gas emissions conditional on the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth rate .
Emissions of these gases should rise at a slower pace than that of the GDP , he says .
The first problem pointed out by critics is that Bush has created a new concept , that of " greenhouse gas intensity , " which could be defined as the volume of gas emissions divided by GDP .
It is this index that will be reduced , according to the White House , by 18 percent over the next 10 years .
But what the US Government does not emphasize is that the natural tendency of the economy is for services to increase their participation in the GDP , and for industrial activities , which are the biggest energy consumers , to diminish .
Therefore , that so-called 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could , in fact , represent a real increase in the absolute quantity of such gases .
Some environmental entities calculate that Bush 's plan will lead to the US 's emitting !
, in 2010 , 29 percent more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990 .
Technical arguments could go on an on , and matter little here .
More important are two indisputable conclusions , both potentially embarrassing to the Bush administration and extremely threatening to the world as a whole .
The first is that , once again , the current US administration , faced with a controversial issue , is situating itself alongside the explicit interests of companies in the energy sector .
The long- standing ties Bush and several of his leading advisors have with these companies allow us to suppose an ultimate conflict of interests that would only increase with the government 's persistent alignment with their goals .
The Enron scandal is already taking a significant political toll of the Bush team , which will tend to increase .
But the consequences of the divorce between the US and the international community in the Kyoto Protocol case could be even more serious .
The second conclusion is that , contrary to what some optimists were predicting after 11 September , Bush seems to have decided to stick to a course of arrogant unilateralism when conducting his foreign policy .
The break with Kyoto had been a pre-attack marker in the Bush administration , for having demonstrated the latter 's absolute indifference to the opinion of even its closest allies , such as Germany , France , the United Kingdom , and Japan .
After the World Trade Center and Pentagon tragedies , there were some who thought that Washington 's rapprochement with its traditional partners was inevitable , with the goal of defeating the threat of international terrorism .
However , after a brief period of shock , Bush resumed his solitary road , as he clearly demonstrated in his State of the Union speech , in which he threatened the " Axis of Evil " countries ( Iran , Iraq , and North Korea ) without consulting the Europeans and Japanese , who do not necessarily agree with the appropriateness of antagonizing the governments of those nations .
The announcement of a plan that is supposedly an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol , but which in practice rejects it in a way that can not be taken seriously by the countries who committed themselves to it ( among which is Brazil ) , only deserves rejection in response and to provoke in retrospect an enormous concern about what the only world superpower intends in future .
These days , the Israeli government is adopting a relatively new tactic regarding its plan to withdraw from the Palestinian cities and towns that it had re-occupied more than three weeks ago .
It is not implementing an immediate and total withdrawal -- as demanded by the international community as a whole and the United States in particular -- but a phased and partial withdrawal .
It does not leave any city or town except after reaching what it calls a security agreement with the Palestinian side for a cease-fire in that particular city or town .
The Israeli Government hopes that this tactic would eventually lead to an integrated and total agreement when all its parts are put together to form a map of " cantons " that Israel envisions for the occupied Palestinian lands .
Israel says that it carried out this tactic in Bethlehem and Bayt Jala , or so it claims , and yesterday , it claimed that it carried out the same tactic in Qalqiliyah when the Palestinian security forces returned to the three centers that had been re-occupied by the invading Israeli forces .
The Israeli press and other media outlets point out that future withdrawals from the cities parts of which are still under Israeli occupation will be carried out in accordance to this tactic of phased and partial withdrawal .
Israel seems to think that this tactic will circumvent the Palestinian move toward independence and will put an end to the Palestinian intifadah by surrounding the areas of tension and dealing with them separately .
The facts show that this Israeli tactic is new only in execution .
Talking about it and about its possible use are several months old and , more exactly , they have been going on since the Israeli Government headed by Ari'el Sharon came to power about nine months ago .
This tactic is no more than an improved carbon copy of the style of " divide and rule . "
It actually reflects Israel 's determination not to deal with the Palestinian issue as one united and indivisible whole .
The inevitable result of this tactic -- if it succeeds in temporarily calming down the situation -- is that it will take back conditions to their former state of tension after the withdrawals are completed from all the Palestinian cities .
The core of the matter is not in the method that Israel is using to crush the Palestinian moves and confiscate the will of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence .
The core of the matter lies in a just and acceptable political framework that Israel is supposed to approve and participate in to put a final end to the occupation and to the settlement construction activities .
Such a political framework would lay the firm foundations for a comprehensive peace based on justice and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people .
Only such a peace can bring security and stability to all the parties without exception .
This being the case , it would be better for both Israel and the Palestinians to have an immediate and parallel Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied parts of several Palestinian cities .
Only such an immediate and parallel withdrawal would expedite the return to serious negotiations between the two sides based on the reference point of ending the occupation , ending settlement construction activities , and restoring the full inalienable rights of the Palestinian people .

Polly Peck International Inc .
's agreement to acquire 51 % of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction .
Polly Peck , a fast-growing British conglomerate , will pay 15.6 billion yen ( $ 110 million ) for 39 million new shares of Sansui , a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions .
Japanese government officials , eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas , hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan .
Polly Peck 's chairman , Asil Nadir , echoed the official Japanese view of the accord , which was announced Friday .
The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has , I think , been demolished at a stroke , " Mr. Nadir said .
But analysts say Sansui is a special case .
It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen .
If you find sound , healthy companies in Japan , they are not for sale , " said George Watanabe , a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc .
Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail , because unlike Sansui , which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges , most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held .
But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year , while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies .
Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases .
If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies were n't deterrents enough , webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers .
Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell , it has few alternatives remaining , and the grim demeanors of Sansui 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's finest hour .
Sansui was once one of Japan 's premier makers of expensive , high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles .
in recent years , the market has moved toward less expensive " mini-component " sets , miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other .
e of Sansui 's fellow audio-specialty companies , such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp. , r
ponded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own , by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields , including laser disks or portable cassette players. Sa
sui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .
the yen soared in recent years , Sansui 's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle. Wh
le competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories , Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia. " O
company has not been able to cope very effectively with " changes in the marketplace , said Ryosuke Ito , Sansui 's president .
even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern , some management consultants maintain .
hihisa Murasawa , a management consultant for Booz-Allen & Hamilton ( Japan ) Inc. , s
d his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future. " A
itudes { toward being acquired } are still negative , but they 're becoming more positive , " Mr. Murasawa said. " I
some industries , like pharmaceuticals , acquisitions make sense . "
ther Polly Peck 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen , but at the news conference , Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around. Sa
sui , he said , is a perfect fit for Polly Peck 's electronics operations , which make televisions , videocassette recorders , microwaves and other products on an " original equipment maker " basis for sale under other companies ' brand names .
said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui 's product line , using Sansui 's engineers to design the new products , and will move Sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck 's own factories .
tever capital it ( Sansui ) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world , that capital will be injected , " Mr. Nadir said .
while Polly Peck is n't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui , it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. ex
cutive as executive vice president and chief operating officer .
h risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir , who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman. He
took Polly Peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980. In
September , it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc. 's
Del Monte foods unit for # 557 million ( $ 878 million ) .
t month , Polly Peck posted a 38 % jump in pretax profit for the first half to # 54.8 million from # 39.8 million on a 63 % rise in sales .
