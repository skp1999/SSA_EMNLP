A detailed document has been issued after China 's recent State of Council session [ as published ] .
In the document serious criticism was made on the expanding military presence by the United States at the international level and it was demanded that the United States should stop the policy of dominating the world .
After the 11 September suicide bomb attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the United States , instead of investigating the matter and coming up with proof , put all the blame for terrorism on Afghanistan .
As a result , the United States formed a coalition with the aim of bringing an end to terrorism and the Taliban , due to which bombardment is still continuing in Afghanistan .
In this operation , the manner in which defenseless , innocent and poor Muslims were blown up by ammunition is one of the most dreadful events in history .
The whole world witnessed this loathsome action by the United States , but no one -- including the Muslim community -- raised a voice against this horrifying act of oppression .
Encouraged by the global community 's shameful silence , the United States has announced the second phase of its war against terrorism .
By declaring Iraq , Iran and North Korea as 'axis of evil ' , the United States has announced to target these countries in the same manner as ! Afghanistan .
North Korea has also been made the target due to the reason that according to the United States , it is being blamed for transferring nuclear technology and weapons to Islamic countries .
The seven countries which the US terms as a threat to its security and against which it can use nuclear weapons , also include Russia and China .
The above-mentioned statement by China is the first ever by an important country after the 11 September events in the United States .
In the document , the United States has been very openly told that it has become the number one country in damaging solidarity of other countries and violating human rights there .
The Iranian President Mohammed Khatami , on the start of his visit to Austria , protested against this dictatorial move by the United States .
He also condemned the statement made by President Bush terming Iran , Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil ' and that these countries are preparing weapons of mass destruction .
Apparently President Bush 's attitude looks like a reaction to the events of 11 September 2001 .
American intellectual Noam Chomsky has proved in his writings that the accomplishment of its goals by aggression and terrorism is a part of the American psyche .
This can be traced back to the events in 1818 , when American cowboys used blind force to oppress the blacks .
Since then , the United States has been raising artificial slogans of preservation of democracy and human rights and developing standards of living .
The actual US objective is the protection of its own interests worldwide for which it does not care for any moral values .
According to the analysis of Chomsky , after World War II , the US think tank had planned to subjugate a few regions of the world for its economic progress .
The Middle East and many countries of the Third World were part of the plan .
During the same period , anti-Soviet hysteria was also promoted strongly .
The CIA was given the task to topple governments and install rulers of its own choice .
As a result , the governments in Guatemala in 1954 and 1963 , Dominican Republic in 1984 , Brazil in 1965 and that of Chile in 1973 were toppled .
It has been clearly mentioned in various documents including the US National Security Council memorandum number 68 issued in 1950 , that US supremacy has to be maintained at any cost .
It can be derived from this that the US attack on Afghanistan without any logic , was not an impulsive action but the psychology of maintaining US supremacy was fully involved in it .
It is possible that the United States itself planned this suicidal attack .
It is due to this hegemony , which the United States wants to maintain , that its State Department makes an assessment of the human rights situation in different countries and prepares a report on their violations all over the world .
The United States has never tried to make a self-assessment .
After the 11 September events , the United States completely ignored the international convention of human rights and by doing so negated its own constitution .
After the events in Washington and New York , approximately 1,000 Pakistanis were thrown into jail , and one person , Mohammed Butt , died of heart failure during detention .
No court case was made against the others arrested nor they were given the right to defend themselves .
Five hundred Taliban prisoners arrested from Afghanistan are being kept in cages on an island near Cuba .
These prisoners have been placed in inhuman conditions and the reason for keeping them on this island is that US law does not apply there .
As a lesson to others ! , various American TV channels , daily , show shots of the conditions under which these prisoners are being kept .
Above all , the US media has reported that the involvement of Jews in the 11 September events can not be ruled out .
The media also reported that 120 Israeli spies were arrested and were exiled from the United States on the orders of the Department of Justice .
This not only shows the double standards of the US but also its selfishness .
This also exposes the background of keeping the US troops and military basis in different parts of the world .
Therefore , China is justified in demanding that the United States , by creating conflicts and by embarking upon the policy of oppression and supremacy should stop interfering in the affairs of other countries in the name of human rights .
According to China , the American society is engulfed by violence and crime .
Racial prejudice has assumed alarming proportions .
There is no protection of women rights including their respect and sanctity .
This report [ above-mentioned document by China ] should be an eye opener for the whole world and the United States should be viewed in its true perspective .
Pakistan also needs to rethink in this regard .
The way in which Pakistan has been fully supporting the United States after 11 September 2001 -- the total benefit of that has been earned by the United States .
Pakistan has not only earned a bad name but also its internal and external problems have increased manifold .
Pakistan should draw its own conclusions in the light of its own circumstances , from this report issued by China .
Instead of blindly accepting every demand made by the United States and responding positively to every American phone call , Pakistan should take every single step carefully .

Some lousy earnings reports whacked the stock market , but bond prices fell only slightly and the dollar rose a little against most major currencies .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 39.55 points , to 2613.73 , in active trading .
Long-term Treasury bonds ended slightly higher .
The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen , but soared against the pound following the resignation of Britain 's chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson .
Analysts have complained that third-quarter corporate earnings have n't been very good , but the effect hit home particularly hard yesterday .
Compaq Computer nose-dived $ 8.625 a share , to $ 100 , and pulled other technology issues lower after reporting lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed Wednesday .
Later yesterday the nation 's major auto makers added to the gloom when they each reported their core auto operations were net losers in the third quarter .
The less-than-robust third-quarter results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading .
Taken together , the worries prompted a broad sell-off of stocks .
The number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that fell in price yesterday exceeded 1,000 , a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts .
Although the government said the economy grew an estimated 2.5 % in the third quarter , in line with expectations , analysts are increasingly predicting much more sluggish growth -- and therefore more corporate earnings disappointments -- for the fourth quarter .
There are a lot more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions , " said Abby Joseph Cohen , a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert .
People are questioning corporate profits as a pillar of support for the equity market .
The bond market was unmoved by the economic statistics .
While bond investors would have preferred growth to be a little slower , they were cheered by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising at a modest annual rate of 2.9 % .
That is another small encouragement for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in coming weeks , they reasoned .
In major market activity :
Stock prices fell sharply in active trading .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 175.2 million shares .

The Argentine TV station Todo Noticias [ " All News " ] reported yesterday that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Saturday night telephoned Cordoba Province Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota , of the Justicialist Party ( PJ ) -- who once served as ambassador to Brazil -- to voice his concern over incidents in the country .
" Cardoso told De la Sota that the images of the protests at the Plaza de Mayo show a country on the verge of a civil war , " one of the channel 's journalists commented .
According to the reporter , the Brazilian president apparently advised De la Sota to move forward the elections , initially slated for March 2002 .
But neither Itamaraty nor the Planalto Palace confirmed the president 's phone call to the governor of Cordoba .
Legislators Request Action from the Brazilian Government
Concern has spread to Brazilian legislators .
Violent attacks at the Argentine legislature sounded alarm bells in the Brazilian political arena , to the point that senators of the official and opposition parties defended more concrete support from the Brazilian Government for Argentina .
Deputy Jose Genoino ( Workers Party -- Sao Paulo ) said that the wave of looting threatens Argentine democracy .
He asked that Brazil promote meetings in the South American continent , or serve as intermediary in negotiations with international institutions .
" This is an unpredictable , anarchical situation .
We do n't know where it will go , against whom .
It is dangerous !
In addition to Argentina there are other countries in crisis , such as Colombia and Venezuela .
We have a very risky scenario .
Any step backward for democracy on the continent would be a disaster .
Brazil can not stand by with its hands folded just watching all of this , " Genoino affirmed .
PSDB [ Brazilian Social Democracy Party ] President Jose Anibal ( Sao Paulo ) said that Cardoso has already placed himself at the disposal of the Argentine Government to talk to international financial institutions .
He noted , " Brazil should adopt an open posture with relation to Argentina , which is experiencing a tragedy . "
For Jose Agripino Maia , PFL [ Liberal Front Party ] leader in the Senate , although Brazil has detached itself from Argentina , it should not disregard the message of the crises that is devastating the neighboring country .
" The political warning must be heeded .
Either one pays attention to the will of the people or what happened will happen. " Maia commented .
Senator Heloisa Helena ( Workers Party -- Alagoas ) said that Latin American countries should always join together to speak with international economic institutions , in order to maintain autonomy in their economies : " Now we see what happens when one country abdicates its financial autonomy .
I hope that this can alert the Brazilian Government to revise its relationship with the IMF . "
Analysts : Lack of Alternative for Power
Political scientists agree : Argentina lacks a political force that can stand up to Peronism and Radicalism .
This is viewed as the main impediment to the establishment of political order in the country .
USP [ University of Sao Paulo ] professor Emir Sader believes that Peronists will remain in power after the elections , slowly growing weaker , allowing room for the emergence of new leadership .
" The degree of pauperization will be brutal .
Everything depends on how long it takes for Peronism to burn out and new leadership to emerge , " Sader said .
For the political scientist , Argentina can not wait for assistance from the American Government .
Latin America is no longer important because the focus now is on global security and no longer on the international economic order .
Sader affirmed , " The new policy of ( US President George W. ) Bush is to permit decay .
The concern now is security .
All eyes are on Pakistan , China , and Russia . "
Moscow , 16 October : Afghan Northern Alliance units led by Gen Abdorrashid Dostum lack weapons and ammunition to properly fight the Taleban , Dostum said , noting that he " has not received " any Russian supplies to the Northern Alliance so far .
Dostum 's units are currently fighting near Mazar-e-Sharif , aiming , in particular , to seize control of populated areas in Samangan Province to block weapons supplies to Taleban units in Mazar-e-Sharif , Dostum said in an interview published in the Tuesday edition of Moskovskiye Novosti .
The general said he currently commands up to 18,000 men , and about 4,000 Taleban fighters " with military hardware " have already gone over to his side .
The US air strikes have destroyed Taleban emplacements near Mazar-e-Sharif , Dostum said .
He also denied reports that the Taleban had concentrated large forces near the border with Uzbekistan .
" There are no such forces on the border with Uzbekistan .
In Hayraton , near the Uzbek town of Termez , there are slightly over 100 Taleban members , according to my estimations , " he said .
Dostum said he intends to serve in the future Afghan government , representing ethnic Uzbeks .
Moreover , Taleban fighters " not stained with blood " could be in this government , too , he said .
Dostum also favoured a possible return of Afghanistan 's former King Mohammad Zaher Shah .
Jordan to sign Kyoto Protocol
AMMAN - Jordan said it will sign the Kyoto Protocol , a UN pact on impeding global greenhouse gas emissions , following a recent Cabinet decision , according to Faris Juneidi , director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection ( GCEP ) .
" Soon , the government will delegate Jordan 's representative to the United Nations , HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad , to sign the protocol , " Juneidi told The Jordan Times on Tuesday , adding that an exact date for signing of the environmental agreement had not been set .
In 1997 , at a UN conference in Kyoto , Japan , the Kyoto Protocol legally obliged developed countries to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent ( below 1990 levels ) between 2008 and 2012 .
Although developed countries are the world 's main source of large-scale air pollution , Jordan 's decision to sign the protocol is aimed at stressing its " commitment towards the different international conventions , " Juneidi said .
With the signing of the protocol , he said , GCEP hopes to attract more funding to contribute to the international community 's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases , which trap heat in the earth 's atmosphere thus causing climate change .
GCEP , an agency operating under the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment , is the country 's point of reference for environmental pacts .
On Monday , the 15 European Union member states agreed to be formally bound to the Kyoto accord , and complete the ratification by June 1 this year .
In March 2001 , the US administration opposed the protocol by saying that it contravenes US economic interests , a decision slammed by European Union countries at the time .
Instead the US government produced its own alternative climate change strategy aimed at encouraging industries to trim their emissions .
Other developed countries like Canada have shown reluctance towards signing the Kyoto Protocol , saying it would cut the national GDP by up to 2.5 per cent in 2010 and cause economic damage worth 30 billion Canadian dollars ( $ 19 billion ) .
Beijing , December 20 ( XINHUA ) -- China believes that the Argentine government and people will overcome the current difficulties , revive their economy and maintain their social stability , said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue here Thursday .
Zhang made the remarks at a regular press conference when asked to comment on the current situation in Argentina .
Zhang said recently some serious disturbances such as shop robberies and traffic breakdowns occurred in Argentina , and some groceries owned by overseas Chinese as well as Argentine citizens with Chinese origin were among those looted .
She added that the Argentine government has declared a 30-day emergency .
China is very concerned about this matter , and the Chinese Embassy in Argentina has asked the Argentine government to ensure the life and property safety of the overseas Chinese and Argentine citizens with Chinese origin , Zhang said .
Following the presidential vote in Zimbabwe , there is just one thing Robert Mugabe can not be reproached for , and that is having made a secret of his determination to stay in power by every possible means .
The electoral hijacking had been announced , prepared , and organized .
It has now taken place .
Should one be surprised ?
Since he nearly lost his parliamentary majority in June 2000 , the head of state has stated and restated to his supporters that the presidential election was going to be a " war . "
He was as good as his word .
The " war for land " continued , at the risk of causing famine .
The army swore allegiance to the " father of independence , " regardless of the verdict at the ballot box .
The independence of Zimbabwe 's justice system was compromised .
The local press was harassed .
The opposition MDC ( Movement for Democratic Change ) was the victim of " state terrorism " that its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai rightly condemned after being beaten in an election loaded against him from start to finish , from drawing up the electoral lists to counting the votes .
The real secret of the ballot box will never be revealed .
This " fait accompli " in Zimbabwe is a challenge for the international community .
It can only rise to meet it by making some radical changes .
Indignant protests apart , nothing was done to prevent the disaster awaiting one of the key countries in southern Africa , seen as the continent 's growth pole .
The weapon of so-called " intelligent " sanctions proved ineffective , especially as the punitive measures were taken too late and only served to deny Robert Mugabe and his associates trips abroad and access to the funds they have spirited away .
They amounted to no more than a ban on holidays and a golden retirement .
Finally and most importantly , Great Britain remained locked in the familiar psychodrama between the former colonizer and colonized .
Africa , with its own " observers , " has just ratified a shameful electoral sham .
Kenya and Tanzania even " congratulated " Robert Mugabe on his re-election after the first round .
It is time to speak the language of truth .
Either the absence of democracy in Africa is no longer any more of a problem for Europe than the lack of development , or it is time to get serious about " good governance " as a condition for aid .
Either the New Partnership for African Development ( Nepad ) is merely to entertain the international gallery during the occasional conference on " sustainable development " or Africa must itself impose a minimum of probity and respect for fundamental liberties .
It has the means .
Robert Mugabe remains in power thanks to the maize , oil , and electricity he supplies to South Africa .
In Zimbabwe it is better to have an end to the torment than torment without end .
Fortunately , Europe is no longer " Africa 's policeman . "
But it must demand that the countries of Africa put their own house in order .
New Argentine president quits after a week ; March vote nixed
BUENOS AIRES - Argentina ended 2001 leaderless and penniless yesterday with its new interim president resigning a week into the job and the country fearing more bloodshed and the loss of savings frozen in the banks .
Plunged into chaos by looting and deadly riots that forced Fernando de la Rua to resign as president a week ago , Argentina fell deeper into anarchy when interim leader Adolfo Rodriguez Saa quit on Sunday after losing his party 's support .
But bickering politicians agreed the crisis was too serious to subject Argentina to the pressure of quick elections , which had been scheduled for March , and decided yesterday to choose an interim leader to rule until 2003 , when De la Rua 's mandate was to end .
Argentina 's biggest political force , the Peronists , who ruled from 1989-99 , withdrew support from Rodriguez Saa , accusing him of being power-hungry , and convinced other parties to accept in his stead Peronist heavyweight Senator Eduardo Duhalde .
Governor Carlos Ruckauf of the vast Buenos Aires province said all parties had to " help the Peronists in a national salvation government ... with consensus that the person in charge until 2003 should be Duhalde . "
De la Rua 's cowed Radical Party agreed , with senior party official Federico Storani saying it would be " madness " to hold elections now " because the interim government would n't have the power to apply measures to get us over this crisis . "
Landed with the provisional presidency for 48 hours , the head of the lower house of Congress , Eduardo Camano , called on senators and deputies to hold a legislative assembly today which should rubber-stamp Duhalde 's appointment .
The country of 36 million people is living in fear of more shop looting and violence that killed 27 people before De la Rua quit , of more riots like those that erupted on Friday and of more misery as a four-year-old recession grinds on .
Already , Latin America 's third-largest economy has declared a moratorium on foreign debt payments - Rodriguez Saa 's first act as leader - and commerce has halted since cash withdrawals were limited to $ 1,000 a month to stop a panic run on banks .
` Shameful '
Ordinary Argentines have been pouring into the streets night after hot summer night , banging pots and pans demanding , and eventually receiving , the resignation of De la Rua , his unpopular economy minister and aides to Rodriguez Saa who were suspected of corruption .
" It 's shameful .
Until all those above us stop stealing , Argentina has no way out , " said a woman lining up outside a bank in the rain from before dawn to try to get her cash .
With New Year celebrations canceled for fear of violence in the worst crisis since the country 's last military coup in 1976 , security chief Juan Jose Alvarez said the capital had been " strongly reinforced with patrols by the federal police , the coast guard and the border police . "
" Today we are millimeters away from a civil war , " said Leopoldo Moreau , a Radical Party congressman .
But despite the heavy guard on the president 's Pink Palace and the Plaza de Mayo outside , there were no rumblings of intervention by the military which has been subordinate to civilian rule since 1983 .
While the moratorium on part of Argentina 's $ 132-billion public debt , heralding the biggest default in history , had long been expected by markets that have dumped Argentine bonds this year , Rodriguez Saa 's plans for a new currency caused alarm .
He had planned to alleviate the cash crunch by minting the " argentino " to circulate alongside pesos , which have been backed up and pegged one-to-one to U.S. dollars for a decade , providing monetary stability and zero inflation .
But the argentino would only be backed by the bricks and mortar of government buildings such as the Pink Palace , and analysts have warned it could devalue and spark inflation .
U.S. President George W. Bush said yesterday he was worried about Argentina , but was confident the country would " stay together " until it chooses a new leader while offering
help once things stabilized .
" Obviously I 'm worried .
Argentina is a very important part of our hemisphere , " Bush said .
" Once they come up with a plan to sustain economic growth , we 'll work with them . "
Following the end of the Cold War , the United States has become the world 's sole superpower and the trend of pragmatism in its foreign policy has become clearer and clearer .
Pragmatism is , in the first place , the United States ' traditional policy .
After coming to power , unilateralism and pragmatism have become Bush 's main foreign policy line .
Alternate use of and complementary nature of pragmatism and unilateralism constitute the characteristics of the Bush administration 's diplomacy .
Once coming to power , Bush insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System [ NMD ] .
The international community and even US western allies , including US neighbor Canada , have consistently opposed the plan .
Despite the opposition , Bush went it alone .
One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [ AMD ] by flashing a carrot on a stick .
At one time , he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race ; on another occasion , he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was " a product of the Cold War era , " and thus has lost its binding force .
He even claimed that to develop the NMD , the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM .
Over the past year , Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N ! MD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system
Even after the adoption of the resolution on " maintaining and abiding by the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly , the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test .
In a word , the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of " attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it , " thereby genuinely securing its status of being the " sole super power . "
The Sino-US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the " two-isms " in its diplomacy .
In the plane collision event , if one goes by the US logic , only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people 's doorsteps ; the host , on the other hand , does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard .
The responsibility for the event , in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished , lies completely with the US side .
The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that " US crew members were detained by the Chinese side. " It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government 's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology .
But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members , major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights , trade , and Olympics hosting issues to " retaliate " against China .
Since coming to power , Bush , proceeding from the US immediate interests , has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties .
This March , catering to the interests of the US oil and coal barons who have made large political donations to the Republican Party , Bush announced , without prior consultations with its allies , that the United States would not enforce the " Kyoto Protocol " which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world .
This announcement was met with unanimous condemnation by the international media .
In July , the Bush administration decided to let the " Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty " " freeze " in the Senate .
Hard on the heels of that decision , the US negotiation representative Marie Chevrier announced in Geneva that the Bush administration would not support the implementation of the " Biological Weapons Convention " and that the United States strongly objected to the concrete enforcement plan of this convention .
The Bush administration either refuses to sign , ratify , or implement international treaties or asks for their revision .
It only wants the international treaties that benefit the US security and economy and globalization .
It does not want anything to do with the international treaties , mechanisms , and organizations that restrict or prevent US freedom .
It does not want anything to do with countries and organizations that do not follow its orders or that always cause troubles to it .
After the 11 September attacks on the United States , the international community strongly condemned the terrorist acts and expressed sympathy and support to the American people .
Supported by the world , the United States launched the " war against terrorism " of this century .
Bush stressed that the war is not only the " US war " but also a " world war . "
The United States views itself as a " major force of anti-terrorism , " for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism .
Bush said , " Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists " and " any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . "
The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country 's attitude toward it .
It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism .
But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan .
Before the 11 September event , the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it .
But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it .
Whether the United States will continue to treat Pakistan in a responsible manner , it is anybody 's guess .
Mugabe won polls unfairly says West
President Rob-ert Mugabe swept back to power in Zimbabwe yesterday after an election fiercely condemned by local monitors , the opposition and the West but praised by African nations .
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , easily beaten by the veteran president according to official results , said Mugabe had stolen the vote through violence and intimidation and by preventing hundreds of thousands of people from voting .
The US said the election , extending Mugabe 's 22-year rule for another six years , was " fundamentally flawed " .
Zimbabwe had ignored its commitment to a free and fair poll .
Two State Department officials said Washington aimed to impose financial restrictions against any assets in the US held by Mugabe and senior members of his government but could not say when they would take effect .
A deep split appeared between Western nations and African countries monitoring the vote , who closed ranks behind Mugabe , calling the election legitimate .
Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede declared Mugabe the winner after results were in from all 120 constituencies .
He said the former guerilla won his fifth term as leader after taking 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,401 for Tsvangirai .
The opposition leader said his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) would not accept the result .
" The election results ... do not reflect the true will of the people of Zimbabwe and are consequently illegitimate , " he said .
Norwegian and local observers said thousands of people , mostly in opposition strongholds , had been prevented from voting .
But observers from South Africa , Namibia and Nigeria all said Mugabe 's re-election was legitimate .
South Africa and Nigeria together with Australia comprise a special Commonwealth group given the power to take measures against Zimbabwe if the election is deemed not to have been free and fair .
Zimbabwe security forces went on high alert and erected roadblocks around Harare after the result was announced .
The MDC said dozens of heavily armed soldiers had surrounded its office in the second city of Bulawayo .
Small groups of armed riot police moved into Harare townships loyal to Tsvangirai .
Several hundred Mugabe supporters danced in celebration and carried mock coffins for Tsvangirai in two Harare townships .
One of the coffins was draped in the US flag .
Mugabe 's government dismissed criticism of the election .
Information Minister Jonathan Moyo said the result was a blow to British Prime Minister Tony Blair whom Mugabe accuses of sponsoring Tsvangirai .
The former colonial power Britain said that Mugabe had held on to power through a " systematic campaign of violence and intimidation " .

BEIJING , April 11 ( AFP ) - China on Thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the United States and Taiwan , demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to US weapons sales .
" The continual sale of arms by the United States or upgrading of relations with Taiwan will only lead to tensions across the straits , " foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said .
" We demand the US strictly abide by the commitments it has made to China , correct its erroneous acts or remarks so as to avoid new harm to China-US relations . "
Zhang further expressed alarm over Washington 's announcement Wednesday that defense department officials will soon visit Taiwan to discuss the sale of eight diesel electric submarines .
" China has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the United States and Taiwan , " Zhang said .
" The Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive issue at the core of Sino-US relations , " she said at the biweekly ministry briefing .
Military tensions in the Taiwan Strait were " not in the self-interests of the United States , " she warned .
She refused to confirm an April 26 to May 3 visit by Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington , as reported in the Hong Kong press .
The visit , if Beijing allows it , is widely expected to be centered on China 's dissatisfaction over the Taiwan issue .
China has considered Taiwan a renegade province since 1949 and has threatened to bring it back by force if it continues to indefinitely refuse proposals for " peaceful reunification . "
Beijing has also long refused to establish diplomatic relations with any nation that maintains official contact with Taiwan , although it has encouraged economic exchanges between Taiwan and all nations .
Zhang also bashed remarks made last month by US Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz at a meeting in Florida , attended by visiting Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yao-Ming .
" The United States is committed to doing whatever it takes to help Taiwan defend itself , " said Wolfowitz , echoing President George W. Bush 's remarks made when he first took office last year .
" Our position is clear , " he continued .
" We do n't support Taiwan independence , but we oppose the use of force . "
Wolfowitz expressed concern about China 's continuing deployment of forces and tactical missiles to areas across the straits from Taiwan .
US officials denied Wolfowitz 's remarks reflected a change in US policy on Taiwan .
Zhang said : " The remarks of the US official are a ... violation of US commitments made ( on Taiwan ) and interference in China internal affairs .
China is firmly opposed to the remarks . "
Chinese missile tests over Taiwan in 1996 resulted in Washington deploying two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region .
The statement by US Secretary of State Colin Powell about the Venezuelan Government triggered yesterday reactions from members of the ruling party .
Mostly , they accused Washington of violating national sovereignty after the US ranking official voiced an opinion about Venezuela 's foreign policy and questioned the democratic nature of the administration of Hugo Chavez .
Last Tuesday , before the US Senate 's Foreign Policy Committee , Powell voiced his concern over " several actions by President Chavez and his ideas of what is a democratic system . "
He also criticized the visits by the chief of state to countries that are on the black list of supporters of terrorism , published by the administration of President George W. Bush , including Cuba , Libya , and Iraq .
Guillermo Garcia Ponce Click here to view picture of Garcia Ponce , chief of the board of directors of the Political Command of the Revolution [ CPR ] , described Powell 's statement as " unusual " and added that it does not reflect the friendly relations between Caracas and Washington .
He stressed : " Venezuela 's domestic policy is the exclusive concern of Venezuelans because of our historical tradition and because it is a constitutional mandate . "
He added : " There is no reason for any country to request the agreement of others to determine its conduct and adopt its decisions . "
Garcia Ponce , who said he was speaking on behalf of the entire CPR , pointed out that it would be " truly inconceivable " that the interference of a state to approve or disapprove the decisions of another or other states became a trait of foreign policy .
" This is not in keeping with the rules of international law and violates the principle of nonintervention in the affairs of other countries , " the top representative of the CPR noted .
However , he ruled out that the statement by the US Foreign Secretary will lead to a change in the policies of President Chavez .
Deputy Cilia Flores , chief of bloc of the Fifth Republic Movement [ MVR ] , used the same tone to express her opinion .
Without mincing her words , she affirmed : " This is an instance of meddling in the policies of this country , which is a sovereign country . "
She added : " Venezuela designs its own policies in an autonomous manner and , in any event , it is up to Venezuelans to decide them .
We respect the sovereignty of all countries and this is why we demand respect for ours . "
As for the criticisms of the destinations of the presidential trips , she remarked : " In addition to the fact that we do not have to ask anyone for permission to decide where and when we should visit a country , the President has visited countries with which we have direct trade relations , countries that are OPEC members , with the specific objective of strengthening our economy . "
Noheli Pocaterra , vice president of the National Assembly , stressed that it is up to Venezuela to decide its foreign policy and the United States must respect its decision .
According to her , the remarks by the US Government spokesman were uncalled-for .
She stated : " We are quite respectful of the decisions made by Washington , even if we do not agree with them .
We demand equal treatment for our foreign policy . "
The opposition seeks intervention or blockade
MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno went even further and established a direct relation between the concerns voiced by the Secretary of State and the disclosure of a video that presumably confirms relations between the Venezuelan Government and the Colombian rebel groups .
Journalists Ibeyise Pacheco , Marta Colomina , Patricia Poleo , and Marianela Salazar disclosed this video in recent days .
The deputy said that Powell 's remarks did not surprise him and added that the US official 's opinion is based on reports published by the domestic and international press , which is waging a ruthless war against the Venezuelan chief of state .
He noted : " The opposition is succeeding at portraying an image of Venezuela that scares away investors and triggers domestic turmoil to request the intervention of foreign powers in the country . "
Thus , Carreno excused the White House official , whom - he argued - was misled by the smear campaign and information sabotage that has been unleashed against Chavez in the country and abroad .
He took one further step and invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see what is really happening .
He accused the four journalists of plotting with powerful economic groups that presumably contributed the funds to purchase the video from an intelligence agent .
He stressed that these journalists should be tried since , according to Article 122 of the Penal Code , any action that instigates interventionist actions is considered treason against the homeland .
Carreno said : " This is what they are trying to accomplish through this campaign and their conduct , which is not that of journalists but of opposition activists , prompted the statement . "
However , he did explain that he is more concerned about reports that Venezuela has relations with organizations categorized as terrorist by the Bush administration than he is about Powell 's statement .
He indicated : " These reports have tried to suggest the existence of ties between Miraflores [ Presidential Palace ] and terrorist groups : There are documents presumably drafted by the FAN [ National Armed Forces ] expressing discontent with the government ; the video disclosed by the journalists ; and [ Justice First Deputy ] Gerardo Blyde 's remarks on the creation of militia groups trained by the guerrillas .
All this has sounded the alarm for the US Executive and suits the opposition 's objectives to bring about an intervention or a blockade , which would hurt the people it claims to defend . "
Oddly , he defended the content of the video by affirming - as the President did - that this is evidence of a humanitarian action .
He argued : " When the United States has faced a situation involving extremist groups holding hostages , they have sent intermediaries to negotiate and no one has said that this shows they have relations with those groups . "
[ Caracas El Nacional ( Internet version ) in Spanish on 7 February carries a related 760-word item that says that some opposition deputies agreed that the government 's tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by US Foreign Secretary Colin Powell .
The report cites Convergence Deputy Alejandro Arzola saying that Powell 's position clearly reflects the concern that exists in the international community and Latin America over the Venezuelan situation : the atmosphere of conflict and the threats against freedom of expression , democracy , and legal security .
Arzola stated : " The government 's positions are not only harming the country at the domestic level , but also at the international level because thousands of investors are watching on their television sets what is happening in Venezuela , where the rule of law is under fire . "
Arzola added : Any recommendation by a country friendly to Venezuela , especially a country that is Venezuela 's No.1 trade partner , must be heeded , as well as recommendations by the Church and the nation , which is demanding a rectification .
The report also cites Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermin , who warned : " When Chavez came to the Presidency , the United States was buying 1.75 million barrels a day .
At present , because of the misguided policy of cutting production , we are only selling them 1.1 million barrels .
If to this , we add the President 's constant aggressive attitude and readiness to establish ties between Venezuela and parasitic economies that give us nothing , but fulfill his political commitments , we will very likely continue to lose our edge in the US market . "
According to Fermin , the chief of state still does not understand that if there is no confidence , there will be no investments .
Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Julio Montoya stated : " The national government has been extremely incompetent in handling relations with the United States .
It has been vague about Venezuela 's intentions regarding the protection of crude prices and the war on terrorism .
Ambiguous situations constitute a breeding ground for bilateral tensions and the fact that currently , we do not even have an ambassador in Washington indicates that we are on the verge of a major breakdown in our relations with our leading trade partner . " ]
AMMAN -- Jordan said it will sign the Kyoto Protocol , a UN pact on impeding global greenhouse gas emissions , following a recent Cabinet decision , according to Faris Juneidi , director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection ( GCEP ) .
" Soon , the government will delegate Jordan 's representative to the United Nations , HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad , to sign the protocol , " Juneidi told The Jordan Times on Tuesday , adding that an exact date for signing of the environmental agreement had not been set .
In 1997 , at a UN conference in Kyoto , Japan , the Kyoto Protocol legally obliged developed countries to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent ( below 1990 levels ) between 2008 and 2012 .
Although developed countries are the world 's main source of large-scale air pollution , Jordan 's decision to sign the protocol is aimed at stressing its " commitment towards the different international conventions , " Juneidi said .
With the signing of the protocol , he said , GCEP hopes to attract more funding to contribute to the international community 's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases , which trap heat in the earth 's atmosphere thus causing climate change .
GCEP , an agency operating under the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment , is the country 's point of reference for environmental pacts .
On Monday , the 15 European Union member states agreed to be formally bound to the Kyoto accord , and complete the ratification by June 1 this year .
In March 2001 , the US administration opposed the protocol by saying that it contravenes US economic interests , a decision slammed by European Union countries at the time .
Instead the US government produced its own alternative climate change strategy aimed at encouraging industries to trim their emissions .
Other developed countries like Canada have shown reluctance towards signing the Kyoto Protocol , saying it would cut the national GDP by up to 2.5 per cent in 2010 and cause economic damage worth 30 billion Canadian dollars ( $ 19 billion ) .
72 Hours At Camp X-Ray
As the detention camp reaches capacity , reporters are invited to watch the interplay between detainees , guards and doctors .
GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE , Cuba - It begins as a shiny speck in the southeast skies of the lone landing strip here at Gitmo , the oldest U.S. base overseas .
Within minutes the lumbering , gray C-141B Starlifter flies low over the tarmac and over a patch of palm trees , as if part of an annual air show .
On a hot and windy afternoon , the deep blue waters of the Caribbean serve as the postcard backdrop .
When the cargo jet finally lands , approaching the landing strip from the west , the noise is deafening .
Almost immediately a crack security force of mostly baby-faced Marines surrounds the plane .
They wear black baseball leg guards and bulletproof vests and carry M-16 rifles .
Meanwhile , Humvees mounted with .50-caliber machine guns and 40mm grenade launchers take their positions .
A Navy helicopter whirls overhead .
Once the aircraft is secured , the freak show begins , a sort of " Hannibal the Cannibal " production .
Down the back ramp of the mammoth aircraft , the guards slowly unload the latest detainees from the war in Afghanistan , 34 altogether .
Wearing bright orange wool knit caps , blacked-out goggles , earmuffs , white surgical masks , bright orange jumpsuits , denim jackets , beige mittens ( taped around the wrists ) , handcuffs and ankle shackles , the detainees do n't look natural .
They look like giant bright orange flies .
After a 25-hour flight of mostly sitting , the prisoners hobble along as the Marines , who look twice as big , walk them out and frisk them .
One soldier handles a captive like a mannequin - moving him back , forward , and to the side - before lifting him straight off his feet and onto one of two waiting buses .
" Walk ! Walk ! " the guards shout .
" Shut up !
Head down ! "
" Man , they must be so scared , " says a TV camerawoman watching with an international media pool from about 400 yards away .
" It must be freaky , " chimes in her colleague .
The prisoners are here because the military considers them " hard-core " terrorists - willing to escape , to kill themselves and others .
But now they do pretty much as directed .
They walk , they shut up , they lower their heads .
They board buses that will take them to a ferry that will take them across Guantanamo Bay to a detention facility known as Camp X-Ray .
A sign near the ferry slip conveys some of the strange vibe of Guantanamo , a 45-square mile naval base in which the detention camp comprises some 3 acres .
The sign touts the area 's wildlife - the brown pelican , the Antillean manatee , the bottlenose dolphin , the hawksbill turtle .
" Watching wildlife can be a lot of fun , " says the sign .
" A pair of binoculars is helpful . "
Last Wednesday , the 10th flight from Kandahar to the southeastern tip of Cuba arrived , bringing the total number of detainees at Camp X-Ray to 288 .
A day later , another 12 came , effectively filling the camp to capacity .
Base officials allowed reporters to record audio and report the landings live via cell phone for the first time since the flights began arriving Jan. 11 .
They refused to allow cameras .
The last time the Pentagon released pictures of the detainees - on their knees , wearing the goggles , and surrounded by guards - the images created an international uproar .
Rights groups cried inhumane treatment .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld denied the allegations , insisting that the detainees have it better here than in Afghanistan .
And he did what he routinely does when questioned about the way the United States is prosecuting the war on terrorism : He reminded critics of Sept. 11 .
When the detainees arrive at Camp X-Ray , they are told they 're in Cuba and then undergo a 45-minute intake process , which , like the airstrip landing , is monitored by the Red Cross .
The routine includes a delousing , or chemical washdown , and a physical .
The detainees also get fingerprinted and photographed .
They get a toothbrush , mint-flavored toothpaste , a bottle of " Lively Salon " antidandruff shampoo , soap , flip flops , a foam sleeping mat , two buckets , a washcloth , a canteen , a prayer cap , two blankets , a sheet , a Koran and two towels , one for praying .
And , strangely , they get to write home .
It 's not that the U.S. military has a soft spot for the mothers of the Taliban or al-Qaida .
Instead , base officials try to glean the prisoners ' real names from the letters , as many tend to give multiple aliases during interrogations .
When they 're done , they 're assigned to the cells in which they will begin their new lives .
These are 8-feet-square , with chain-link sides and tin roofs .
The Halogen lights stay on all night .
The next day starts with prayer call about 5 a.m .
A sign on a pole at the edge of the camp points the direction to Mecca .
The prisoners come from 31 countries , including Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Pakistan , Algeria , England , Egypt , Australia , France , Russia , Belgium and Sweden .
Base officials say there are Christian prisoners as well as Muslims .
After prayer , the detainees ' day goes like this : breakfast , a shower ( every other day ) , sick call , noon prayer , lunch , recreation ( 15 minutes a couple of times a week ) , mail call , sunset prayer , dinner , evening prayer and bedtime around 9 p.m .
Each meal the detainees get is considered halal , or religiously appropriate for Muslims .
A typical breakfast includes oatmeal , an orange , fresh bread and a bottle of water .
For lunch , it 's pasta or vegetable stew , dry cereal including Froot Loops , a box of raisins , two granola bars , a bag of chips , and bag of peanuts and water .
For dinner they get white rice , red beans , a banana and water .
U.S. Army Capt. Sean Campion , one of the camp guards , characterizes life at Camp X-Ray as " utter boredom . "
" If you do your job right , " says Campion , 32 , of Kansas City , Mo. , " nothing is scheduled to happen . "
The guards mostly communicate with the prisoners via simple English commands and hand signals .
" We 're not holding any lengthy debates with them or anything , " Campion says .
Marine Corps Lt. Abuhena Mohammad Saiful-Islam , 39 , speaks more with the detainees than almost anybody at the camp .
As the Muslim chaplain , he ministers at the facility up to five hours every day .
He says that with the start of the Muslim month of pilgrimage , during which the faithful journey to the holy city of Mecca , he detects more anxiety in the camp .
Base officials are considering a special meal for March 10 .
" The role of chaplain is unique , " Saiful-Islam says .
" We do n't go with a preconceived idea that the person is so and so .
As a chaplain we approach them as a human being .
" We do n't hate the sinner , " he says , " but we hate the sin . "
Somebody asks Saiful-Islam if the relationship between the detainees and God has changed since their capture .
" They have n't said that God has abandoned them , because they know , " he says .
" That 's the hope that they have , that God is their only hope .
" They do ask me what 's going to happen .
At this moment , I do n't have an answer . "
Concertina wire and nine guard towers surround Camp X-Ray .
The American flag is everywhere - painted on the guard towers , flying high in front of the facility .
Unlike other parts of the base , the camp does not have a pretty setting .
Turkey vultures hover over thick brush and scraggly hills .
It is day two at X-Ray for the 34 newly arrived from Kandahar .
A German shepherd and his handler patrol the camp 's perimeter .
Bright orange figures sit in their cells , some of them praying .
One or two prisoners run for exercise in a fenced area , wearing handcuffs but no ankle shackles .
Every so often a prisoner is led to one of five interrogation rooms , freshly built wood buildings with air conditioners and no windows .
Three guards accompany him - one on either side and one behind .
One of the guards puts a hand behind the head of the detainee , forcing him to look down .
This is done to " provide positive control , " says U.S. Army Col. Terry Carrico , in effect the prison warden .
" It means he ca n't look ahead .
He ca n't make a plan .
They do n't know where they 're going .
That 's a technique across correctional facilities in the United States . "
Except for an occasional spitting incident or threat , officials say , the prisoners are docile .
Base officials suspect that the people already in custody pass the word along to the new arrivals that they will be treated okay .
" In the beginning , they were very unsure , " says Carrico .
" They did n't know if we were going to take care of them , hurt them or kill them . "
Some guards do n't want to talk about their views of the prisoners .
But U.S. Army Capt. Darrell Sides , 30 , of Fort Benning , Ga. , makes no bones about considering them terrorists .
" We were all watching television Sept. 11 , " he says .
" The security here I would consider tighter than death row in a prison in the United States . "
The morning run to Fleet Hospital 20 takes place as scheduled .
This is for prisoners needing medical attention , as a fair number do .
Some are underweight , others are missing toes , fingers and limbs .
The hospital is several miles from Camp X-Ray , off Recreation Road .
Along the way , if allowed , the detainees would get to see a bit of Americana , a portrait built over the past century .
U.S. forces seized Guantanamo Bay during the Spanish-American War .
In 1903 , the U.S. government signed a lease with the Republic of Cuba .
That contract , extended indefinitely in 1934 , can be broken only by mutual agreement .
The growth of the base has left Camp X-Ray surprisingly close to a suburban-style military community of beige , green and yellow houses in subdivisions with names like Caribbean Circle and West Iguana .
Two boys in white karate outfits run down palm-lined Sherman Avenue .
Another child , no more than 3 or 4 , plays on a gym set , with a young woman keeping a watchful eye .
Also up the road is the W.S. Sampson Elementary School , replete with yellow school buses , the Morale Welfare and Recreation Cooper Field with baseball and soccer fields , and the base 's outdoor movie house , which is playing the movie , The Majestic .
The 20-bed hospital is a high-tech , air-conditioned white tent which looks like a futuristic movie set , with low ceilings , fluorescent lighting , and padded white walls , floors and ceilings .
The staff calls it a " temper tent . "
On this morning , U.S. Navy hospital corpsman Shuron Jerome , 19 , of Houston is poring over a box of Valentines sent to Guantanamo by schoolchildren in Pennsylvania .
" Wish you could be with your family , " one child has written .
Jerome says the hospital feels no different than a hospital in the states , save for the high security and the various languages the detainees speak , including French , Russian , Urdu and Arabic .
Most understand a little English , she says .
While she sees the detainees as patients , she allows that they 're not " regular patients . "
She often finds herself thinking , " Oh , my God , they could be related to this or related to that .
But I still try to treat them as a patient . "
Fleet Hospital 20 has nine patients today .
The bulk of the work includes blast and gunshot wounds from the war in Afghanistan .
Just the other day , however , a surgeon took out the eye of a patient who had suffered a sports injury when he was younger .
The pressure on the eye had become unbearable .
The story got international play because it seemed to underscore the fact that tensions between the Americans and the detainees were easing .
Indeed , the patient invited the surgeon for a cup of tea after the operation .
The staff gives reporters a quick tour of the hospital , allowing photographs of some sections but not of the patients .
As an al-Jazeera television crew walks through , the staff rolls out a patient who has just had his right index finger amputated as a result of a gunshot wound .
The cameraman continues filming while a nurse covers the patient 's face .
In the recovery room , the patient 's body starts trembling .
The doctors explain this is a common reaction as patients awake from anesthesia .
Still , it provides a bit of drama .
" Michel ! Michel ! " yells a doctor still in her operating clothes .
" You 're doing good . "
Another doctor , speaking with a French accent , adds , " Good job , buddy . "
Finally , an interpreter comes in to talk to the patient .
Eight other young-looking men , with shaved heads and beards growing , recover in their cots .
Most of them sleep .
The medical staff relies on linguists to help communicate with the patients , but they 've also come up with their own inventions , such as a longhand list of English phrases and their Arabic counterparts .
In a pinch , they show the patients the list , which includes the following phrases : I 'm in pain .
Thirsty .
Hungry .
Bathroom .
Urinate .
Arm .
Hand .
Leg .
Back .
IV Hurts .
Cold .
Hot .
Sick , will throw up .
While calm has returned to Fleet Hospital 20 , officials elsewhere on the base are bracing for what they say may be inevitable : the death of one of the detainees .
Not at the hands of the guards .
But with 300 already in custody , and scores in poor health to begin with , they say something is bound to happen .
In a briefing with reporters , Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Michael R. Lehnert , the commander of the prison project , says , " We continue to work to improve living conditions for both the detainees and our security forces . "
Within a couple months , he says , the operation will move to another part of Guantanamo called Radio Range , where utilities are more readily available and cells will have cots , air conditioning and toilets .
The general is awaiting congressional approval before building for Radio Range begins .
For now , with the camp at capacity , flights here have stopped .
Paris , July 11 ( CNA ) -- Taiwan 's economy will become totally dependent on mainland China within the next few years , causing the island to lose control of its own political fate , a French weekly warned Thursday .
The Nouvel Observateur said that Beijing is unlikely to annex Taiwan by force , despite its deployment of missiles along its coastal provinces opposite Taiwan , but is instead resorting to smarter tactics , bringing the Taiwan authorities to heel through Taiwan businessmen who are eager to explore the mainland Chinese market .
The weekly said that mainland China has attracted more than US $ 50 billion in investment from Taiwan thus far , while the Taipei authorities bowed to pressure from its own businessmen to lift restrictions on investment in mainland China in May , a move expected to speed up the flow of Taiwan capital to its arch rival .
Barring any reversal to the trend , the weekly quoted U.S. magazine Business Weekly as saying that Beijing might bring the island to its knees without firing one bullet .
Another factor which might deter Beijing 's military adventurism in the Taiwan Strait is Washington 's " readiness to fight Beijing for Taiwan , " which will bear witness to Washington 's determination to remain a power in Asia , according to the magazine .
The publication quoted Wu Guoguang , a professor at Hong Kong University , as saying that any concessions by Washington on the Taiwan issue could trigger a defection of its Asian allies , including Japan , to Beijing 's fold .
But Beijing 's leaders are not likely to blink on the issue either because an independent state in Taiwan would boost the schisms in Tibet and Xinjiang and threaten the regime in Beijing , the magazine claimed .
Although there is only scant possibility of a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait , the Nouvel Observateur said , Beijing 's military buildup in its southern coastal provinces still makes the region " the most heavily armed place in the world next only to the Middle East , " and a dangerous flashpoint in the 21st century .
Brussels - New confidential documents indicate that current Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the army 's former leadership were directly responsible for massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in 1982 .
Lawyers for the survivors , who have filed a complaint against Sharon in Belgium , said this .
On behalf of some Palestinian survivors , lawyers Luc Walleyn and Michael Verhaeghe on 18 June filed a complaint with the Brussels Public Prosecution Office against Sharon and other Israeli and Lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in Beirut .
A few days after filing the complaint , the lawyers received a stack of documents in Hebrew and in English regarding the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the Sabra and Shatila events .
The documents include meeting reports , and intelligence service and interrogation reports .
The lawyers refused to reveal the source of the documents .
Judging from a few texts that De Standaard was given access to , the documents seem to be related to the Israeli Kahan Commission .
This special commission investigated the Sabra and Shatila events in 1982-1983 .
It published a report , but not all the documents and interrogation reports were released , because they were deemed damaging to the state 's interests .
Walleyn are Verhaeghe are convinced of the authenticity of the documents .
They gave the entire stack to Investigating Magistrate Patrick Collignon .
The lawyers expect that the Public Prosecution Office will request Israel to confirm the documents ' authenticity .
It had already been known that Lebanese Phalangist militias , which perpetrated the massacres , cooperated closely with Israel , but according to the lawyers , various documents now indicate that Israel and the Phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance , that Israel exercised complete control over the militias , and that , in the wake of the massacres , the Israeli army instructed the Phalange to assume responsibility .
" In practice , the Phalangist militias operated directly under Israeli command .
Senior generals and Sharon bore command responsibility [ preceding two words published in English ] for the militias ' actions .
According to Belgian and international criminal law , they could be held responsible , " Verhaeghe said .
Tomorrow , the Chamber for Indictments will begin the debate on Investigating Judge Collignon 's questions on the legitimacy of the case against Sharon .
A ruling is expected by the end of this year or early next year .
In the meantime , the lawyers have also initiated a civil suit against Elie Hobeika , the militia leader who is regarded as one of the main perpetrators of the massacres .
In the complaint , Hobeika had not yet been called by name .
The lawyers deemed it wise to do this now because one of Collignon 's questions is connected with the juridical consequences of a Lebanese amnesty law .
Khatami congratulates Venezuelan nation for Chavez ' return
Tehran , April 20 , IRNA -- President Mohammad Khatami on Friday evening congratulated the Venezuelan government and nation for the victory and restoration of the legitimate government of President Hugo Chavez after a failed military coup in that country .
During a telephone conversation , President Khatami told his Venezuelan counterpart , President Hugo Chavex , that the return of the legitimate president and government to power was a victory of justice and freedom .
The Iranian president also expressed the hope that with the return of President Chavez the Venezuelan government would be able to achieve its exalted objectives with the support of the people .
Referring to the difficult period the venezuelan nation went through in the past week , President Chavez said the anti-democractic attempts to topple his government failed with the help of the Almighty God and the people .
As to the re-establishment of legal order in his country , Chavez briefed the Iranian president on the latest developments in his country .
Referring to the objective of those who were behind the military coup in Venezuela , Chavez said they wwanted to have Venezuela come out from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and therefore tried to produce more oil in order to undermine the organization .
President Chavez thanked President Khatami for his telephone call and wished success for the Iranian government and nation .
The two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet in the near future .
Iran , Sunday last week , sent congratulations to Venezuela on hearing of the return of the rule of law and reinstatement of the legitimate government of President Chavez after the two-day military collapsed .
On Saturday it condemned the the ouster of the democratically elected president of Venezuela , saying , " resorting to a coup and the use of force is not an acceptable method to bring about political change and the method is not in conformity with the norms of present human society . "
Chavez was brought back to the Venezuelan presidential palace early Sunday by helicopter from a Caribbean island where he was detained after the coup and thereafter resumed his functions as president .
Chavez , whose mandate was due to end in 2006 , was forced out of office by the country 's armed forces who blamed him for the deaths of 15 people during demonstrations in the streets of central Caracas against an opposition protest which later became violent .
Chavez is a staunch supporter of oil production cuts in order to boost prices in the world market .
He initiated a successful Caracas OPEC summit in September 2000 , the second in the 40-year existence of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
On the agenda of tomorrow 's meeting of the Russian government is the question of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol -- a highly important international document that is supposed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
And a few days ago , on the initiative of the Foundation for Integrated Applied Research , the problem was taken up by well-known scientists .
A small circle of experts , in the presence of an even smaller circle of journalists , attempted to define Russia 's place in global climatic strategy .
The 15 member nations of the EU announced last fall , at a conference in Morocco , their firm intentions to ratify the Kyoto Protocol .
Iceland , Japan , Australia and Canada are ready to join the ratification .
The world community became hopeful that it would be possible to solve the problems that brought about the UN Convention on Climate Change ( 1994 ) .
There is a Proposal to Take Shelter Under an Umbrella
The first to raise the problem 40 years ago was the Soviet scientist Mikhail Budyko , who saw that the curve on a graph of the air temperature of the earth 's surface stratum was inexorably moving toward the upper right-hand corner .
Participants in the debate also proceeded from the postulate that the earth 's atmosphere has been heating up over the past 100 years .
It is another matter that the reasons for this alarming phenomenon are not completely clear , and experts offer different interpretations of the consequences of global warming .
Rumor has it that the late author of the greenhouse model told Academician Roald Sagdeyev : " I 'm a little uneasy when I tell the Americans about my model , because it suggests that Russia 's agriculture will gain from global warming , while America 's agriculture will lose. " Sagdeyev looked at Budyko with interest : " But then where will we buy grain ? "
And now Andrey Gudkov , an expert at the Center for Strategic Studies , follows Budyko in insisting that Russia , as well as Canada and Alaska , gain , since " lands situated in a condition of permafrost will gradually turn into fertile soils for agricultural production . "
But the rich Russian fields that stretch across the Arctic zone are small comfort to humankind as a whole , so Gudkov proposes blocking off the sun with an umbrella that would be suspended in space .
The expert immediately sketched on a blackboard what this should look like , mixing up chemical symbols : rockets would carry metallic sodium into orbits around the earth .
Cooling aerosols dispersed over the polar zones would prevent overheating of the tundra during sunny summer nights .
True , the sun-screening space umbrella ( the author 's name ) does not have much chance of opening up , due to " political-economic circumstances . "
Indeed , the idea has not yet captivated the masses so much that they would remove their last trousers to start investing immediately in the project .
But the expert urged everyone to despair , " since control of global warming without Russia is impossible ; the country is becoming the owner of the controlling block of shares . "
In Mr. Gudkov 's view , everything is developing well , we can take our time , and we can do nothing at all , since global warming is a threat only to the southern countries .
The Obvious is Incredible
The speaker 's ardor was cooled by the well-known Sergey Kapitsa , who is not inclined to give way to rapture over the advantages promised to Russia .
He also questions the predicted amount of future warming .
Six degrees , the professor believes , is unlikely , since that kind of thing has not happened on the planet in the past 420,000 years .
This is indicated by a well drilled in the ice cap of Antarctica 30 years ago , which helps to comprehend what has happened to climate .
In addition to the suggestion from the sixth continent , it is a good idea to recall the Great Flood , which has been depicted , apart from the Bible , in many of the world 's mythologies : " What was it ?
Before predicting the future , we must learn how to predict the past , " Kapitsa summed up .
In his view , it would not be a bad idea , when the scientific community draws up all sorts of forecasts and plans of action that flow out of them , for it to seek help from the science of paleoclimatology and to gain a broad understanding of its data .
No one wanted to argue with the master .
A consensus was arrived at that climate has always changed , but it has never occurred with such speed .
Some terminological refinements came up as well .
For example , Prof. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan maintain that " we must not speak of warming , but of global climatic changes ; warming is merely one aspect of these changes . "
What is cited as the reason for them , the scientist continues , " is almost always the increase in the greenhouse effect due to a larger concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
This concentration grows , in turn , it is usually written , due to the burning of a huge quantity of organic fuel ( oil , natural gas , coal , wood , peat , etc. ) by industry , transport , agriculture and households .
But this is not the only cause of climatic change .
It is n't even the only cause of the increase in the greenhouse effect . "
Those in attendance did not argue .
On the contrary , they found solidarity in the view that it is impossible to explain everything with models .
Models are flawed , including the greenhouse model , and the only thing that is beyond dispute is that warming is underway , and the contribution of human beings to this alarming condition is very large , possible at least 30 percent .
If One Lies on a Stove ...
Our country has something like a controlling block of shares , since without Russia and the US the Kyoto Protocol will die .
And if the States behave badly , we are simply obligated to ratify this document -- this was the conclusion arrived at by the round table .
The gist is that , according to the Kyoto terms , quotas can be sold , that is , if you have fewer emissions than your neighbor , then you have every reason to strike an advantageous deal .
True , this clause has been stirring up a lot of questions for a long time .
The discussants also presented differing views on the trading of air .
Some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for Russia , which has " hot air " ( that is , it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of CO2 emissions ) , and the country can become the dominant seller in the market ; consequently , it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .
We will also gain from the fact that compliance by other nations with the terms of the protocol will lead to higher demand for gas , of which we have huge resources .
So if anyone doubts whether Russia should ratify the document , he is deeply mistaken .
True , this position makes one think of Yemelya 's [ illusory ] happiness and worry about the future development of the country ( both technological and economic as a whole ) .
Fortunately , supporters of the idea of lying on a stove found an opponent .
Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy , a senior adviser to the Foreign Ministry 's Department of International Organizations , took up this role .
He described the opinion that Russia can gain from perturbations of the climate as false .
" When we determine the position of the diplomatic service , we proceed from the premise that the whole strategy of nature-conservation efforts is not profitable but costly and that it is impossible to solve the problems of environmental protection on our own ... The Kyoto mechanism is costly , but its value lies in the fact that its implementation has been tied to the market mechanism , that is , life without change has been made uneconomical . "
In short , if you do n't want to exert yourself , buy the neighbor 's quota ; if you do n't want to spend the money , use your brain and invest in the development of nature-conservation technologies .
Consequently , if our homeland 's efforts boil down merely to dealing in " hot air , " this will not provide an impetus to start up high technologies and will knock Russia out of the group of countries that are striving for rational development , above all out of the European Union .
This is just the time to recall that the energy requirements of Russian output are among the highest in the world ( see graph [ omitted here ] -- Ed. ) .
The Foreign Ministry , said N. Ratsiborinskiy , clarifying his agency 's position , recommends that the government move to ratify , since the view at Smolenskaya Square is that the impact of our national efforts will be greater if they are integrated into the efforts of the EU .
" The assessment by the Foreign Ministry official is brilliant , " exclaimed Aleksandr Ginzburg , deputy director of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics .
" This is the best thing I have read or heard about the Kyoto Protocol !
" It is hard to disagree with this .
Background
The document that was given the name of the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 in the Japanese city of Kyoto .
It was aimed at reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and assigns countries quotas on their emissions .
As of today , more than 80 nations ( all the developed countries and almost all of the CIS countries ) have signed the Kyoto Protocol , and almost 40 have ratified it .
Russia signed the document three years ago , in March 1999 .
Russia is third in the world in total emissions -- after the US and China .
Russia 's emissions are almost twice as great as those of Germany and Japan ( in fourth and fifth places ) .
American at first signed the document , but a year ago President Bush announced that he would not impose regulations in his country on the discharge of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
This meant , in effect , that the US withdrew from the accords .
What Preceded the Kyoto Protocol ?
It was preceded by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change .
It was adopted on 9 May 1992 and entered into force 21 March 1994 .
A total of 186 nations are parties to the convention , including Russia , all of the developed countries and all of the CIS countries .
The convention was designed to unite efforts to prevent dangerous climate changes and to achieve a stabilization of the content of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a relatively safe level .
A decision was adopted at the first conference of convention participants ( 1995 , Berlin ) to begin phased actions to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases and to create an appropriate system of ecological-economic relations .
Facts
Six greenhouse gases are known .
The principal one is CO2 ( it is responsible for 80 percent of the greenhouse effect ) .
Methane 's contribution is 15 percent .
Facts
According to estimates by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Energy , Russia 's total carbon-dioxide emissions in 2008-2012 will be 20 percent below the 1990 level .
This means that Russia will be able to offer the carbon market emission quotas of up to 3 billion tons .
The cash equivalent could be several tens of billions of dollars .
Background
The Ecological-Economic Meaning of the Kyoto Protocol
This is the first international document that makes use of the market mechanism as an approach to solving global ecological problems .
It provides for economic mechanisms of international cooperation .
In Russia , up to 98 percent of all emissions of the main greenhouse gas -- CO2 -- come from the burning of fossil fuels ( coal , oil , gas ) .
This means the problem of reducing emissions is a problem of energy efficiency and energy saving .
So far this potential has been utilized only to a small degree , whereas there are almost no such reserves left in the EU countries and Japan .
That is why carrying out a project and reducing emissions in Russia is far cheaper than in most developed countries .
The Obligations of Foreign Countries Under the Kyoto Protocol
Developed countries and transitional economies must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 by at least 5 percent from the recognized baseline year of 1990 .
The reduction level varies .
The US , Japan and members of the EU must reduce emissions by 7 , 6 and 8 percent from the 1990 level .
A limitation , rather than reduction , of emissions is specified for several developed countries ( New Zealand , Norway ) , and Australia and Iceland received the right to increase emissions .
If a country fails to use up its quota , it can sell the " surplus . "
Russia 's Obligations Under the Kyoto Protocol
They are relatively mild for our country .
We are not required to reduce emissions , but over five years ( from 2008 through 2012 ) we do not have the right to exceed their volume .
This approach is based on the fact that Russia 's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990 , and , according to forecasts , the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years .
This is substantiated in detail in the RF Energy Strategy Until 2020 , which the government has adopted .
Within the framework of the protocol our country must maintain records of , and monitor , emissions and emission quotas , as well as regulate quotas .
This requires creating a national system of inventorying emissions and establishing a special registration center to maintain records of quotas .
Despite the outward complexity of the task , the creation of a record-keeping and monitoring system is neither very complicated nor very expensive , since the Goskomstat [ State Statistical Committee ] reporting forms that enterprises fill out contain virtually complete data .
Experts ' Opinion
No One Will Be Well Off
Should we be happy about climate change ?
Many people in Russia say : how much fuel we 'll save !
But the warming will definitely not be uniform .
If the mean temperature rises by 2 degrees , the range of fluctuations will widen and will go , for example , from -40 to +45 degrees .
So there will not be less of a need for fuel if , on the average , one winter out of every three winters becomes much colder than the harshest previous one .
And what will happen during the new , overly warm summer seasons ?
What will happen to industrial and transport facilities , housing and other infrastructure that were built in permafrost , which will turn into muddy swamp ?
The unbalancing of the climate will have a very negative effect on ecosystems .
Some species are disappearing , while others , conversely , are starting to multiply will unprecedented speed .
Gangster species are appearing , such as the locust , which is moving toward the north , where it has never been before .
It is hard to say today what will happen to edaphic microflora , which is of fundamental importance to soil fertility .
If microflora stop reproducing humus , the higher plants will die , agricultural crops will stop growing , and timber will start to dry up .
If the glaciers of Antarctica and Greenland melt down , the level of the world 's oceans will rise .
Russia has quite a lot of low-lying areas , such as St. Petersburg .
The enormous territory of Western Siberia risks turning into a sea .
All of Our Activities Are Ruining Nature
There are several models today , and they answer the question of why the climate is changing with varying degrees of persuasiveness .
Why do n't I have the sense that the models explain everything ?
The problem is that the present stage of study of small climatic models has scientists studying the life of the models as the life of a real climatic system .
But to what extent does this reflect real life ?
Nevertheless , the progress in gaining knowledge has been tremendous .
Our institute , along with the Institute of Systems Analysis and the Russian Academy of Sciences Computer Center , has begun studying the role of climate change in individual regions of Russia in order to forecast economic development .
There are no results to speak of yet , but it is important that this area of inquiry has appeared .
During a general warming , completely opposite phenomena take place .
In the polar regions , climate changes are more pronounced than in the middle latitudes .
As a result , the temperature does n't change much in the equatorial and middle latitudes but changes a great deal in the polar regions .
What does this lead to ?
Dispersion is less active , and so-called obstruction or stagnant situation manifest themselves in the atmosphere more and more often .
We have just observed such a case of a very lengthy thaw in the center of Russia .
Incidentally , last year 's incredibly cold winter in Primorskiy Kray was very possibly an example of the same property .
Because , strange as it may seem , prolonged , stagnant cold spells are also a result of global warming when there is less ventilation of the atmosphere as a whole .
As for all the ideas regarding blocking shields , umbrellas and the like , I will answer this way .
The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change .
There are no proposals there to erect screens or to shoot cooling aerosols into the atmosphere .
Already everything humankind does causes incredible damage to nature .
We emit greenhouse gases , we thaw out the frozen regions that emit methane , we destroy forests , and in the south , deserts are expanding , a process that alters the heat exchange between the earth 's surface and the atmosphere .
That is , all of our actions are accompanied by a deterioration in the climate .
In this situation it is very frightening to do anything else -- for example , to suspend some umbrella , screen or something else in that vein .
FLORIDA ASTRONAUTS REPAIR SPACE STATION WINGS
CAPE CANAVERAL -- Two space-walking astronauts went out on a repair job Monday and wrapped thermal covers around a pair of motors that turn the International Space Station 's giant solar wings .
NASA hopes the covers will shield the motors against the temperature extremes of space and eliminate power spikes and stalls .
The motors keep the solar wings pointing toward the sun and generating electricity .
Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani floated out of space shuttle Endeavour and grabbed onto the ship 's robot arm for a 50-foot ride up the side of the space station .
It 's hard to believe that the holiday season is only two months away .
At Pleasant Run , Inc. we are making plans and arrangements for our children and families .
Every year we seek companies , organizations and individuals to sponsor one or more of our families .
These families are participants in our community-based programs .
These programs focus on keeping the family together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family .
After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils , beds , cleaning supplies , etc. We meet these needs immediately .
But , the holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families .
They do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal .
We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this holiday season .
If you are interested and would like more information , please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at 693-9222 .
We would like to have families matched with sponsors non later than xxxx .
Thank you for considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for a family in need .

[ " Opinion " U.S. Human Rights Claims Only Empty Rhetoric ]
The U.S. State Department on Monday published its annual report on the status of human rights in other countries in the year 2001 .
In this report , when referring to Iran , the United States repeated its allegations against the Islamic Republic but failed to provide any evidence in support of its baseless charges .
Among the unfounded allegations was the claim that the Islamic Republic enjoys no social base and is an unpopular system because of its human rights violations .
However , the massive participation of millions of Iranians in the grand rallies on Feb. 11 to mark the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution and defy U.S. threats against this country once again revealed the emptiness of U.S. charges against Iran .
It is quite clear that such baseless accusations are only made to tarnish the image of Iran , since it follows an independent policy and refuses to bow to U.S. domination .
It is interesting that the U.S. State Department 's annual global human rights report came this year at a time when Washington itself is being sharply criticized by most countries and international human rights organizations for the killing of a large number of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture and inhuman treatment of the Taleban and Al-Qaeda prisoners at its military base at Guantanamo Bay .
Indeed , the U.S Administration , which claims to advocate international human rights issues and which tries to play the role of a world policeman , is actually condoning the most atrocious human rights violations committed in the United States itself .
The ugliest crimes are perpetrated against inmates in U.S. prisons , and the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by the U.S. police is so appalling that on several occasions it has led to massive riots .
For instance , a bloody riot was ignited in Cincinnati when an Afro-American youth was shot dead for no reason by police officers .
Although the United States claims to advocate human rights , its harsh treatment of its own citizens and its hegemonic and belligerent policy towards other nations prove that the claim is just empty rhetoric .
Taipei , Aug. 17 ( CNA ) -- The Republic of China [ ROC ] government will push for Chinese language education among the vast number of Chinese communities in Southeast Asia , a high-ranking ROC official said Friday .
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission ( OCAC ) head Chang Fu-mei made the remarks after concluding a symposium on work in the Asia-Pacific Chinese communities .
Chang said after visiting Chinese communities in the United States , New Zealand and Southeast Asia that education and cultural work needs to be further strengthened in the Chinese communities in Southeast Asia .
With the limited funding to which her commission is entitled , Chang said , OCAC will focus its educational and cultural work on Chinese communities with the fewest resources , such as those in Myanmar [ Burma ] , Vietnam and Indonesia .
The minister went on to say that although mainland China is squeezing Taiwan 's development space in the world community with its huge resources and strong diplomacy , the ROC can still break through its difficulties as long as it implements democracy and obtains the support of overseas Chinese communities .
A total of 38 overseas Chinese community leaders from nine Asian and Pacific countries attended the symposium , at which the participants also exchanged views on cross-Taiwan Strait relations .
The buffer zones that Ariel Sharon intends to establish are an explicit admission that Israelis can no longer live by the sword , that the occupation is not working , and Israeli reprisals are not meeting with success .
Thinking of building a Great Wall of China in the Middle East , replete with elaborate fences and tunnels , is conceding that Israel is not safe , not a normal country .
It can not integrate itself into the region , it is an alien seedling and , thus , it is better to isolate and fortify itself as a lowly outpost .
A total disengagement from the Palestinians , complete with walls and razor wire , might provide Israel its long-desired security and might free it of the burden of trying to control seven million desperate Palestinians , any number of whom are willing to die in order to end the occupation .
But separation will not mean an end to the occupation and no Israeli government can provide security as long as it persists in its efforts to maintain its presence beyond Israel 's pre-1967 borders and to retain territories inhabited by millions of Palestinians .
By now , it should be clear to everyone that retaliating against every act of Palestinian resistance with Israel 's superior ability to punish Palestinians does not provide the security that Israelis are demanding .
The only way out of the current spiral of violence is for Israel to limit itself to areas within which it can assume responsibility for its citizens ' security .
This means a return to Israel 's pre-1967 borders .
Practically speaking , a buffer zone will be near impossible to erect .
A physical border between Israel and a new Palestinian state will be twisted and distorted to accommodate Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza .
Unilateral separation without a negotiated agreement could be realized - only if Israel is willing to uproot around 100 settlements .
Sharon says flatly he will not withdraw from a single settlement .
He thinks that every settlement is important and is determined that Israelis must retain as much land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as possible .
Then there is the eventual goal of the peace process : the coexistence of Israel with the state of Palestine .
But Israel has not once deigned to propose that the Palestinians live with the Israelis as full citizens in the same sate .
Israel does not want the Palestinians to be part of the same country , or have one of their own .
By a margin of 2-1 , Israelis think Sharon has no plan to end the violence and the buffer idea buttresses this long-standing view .
Sharon has not brought the Israeli public security .
With grim determination , he has destroyed the peace process and the Oslo agreements .
And now he doggedly continues to demolish and prevent any hope of a road to peaceful coexistence .
Israelis do not wonder any longer how to get along with Palestinians but how to avoid the need for it .
Sharon has ensured that Israelis are rapidly absorbing the lesson that no place in Israel can be considered safe .
A wall and miles of fences is not the best of solutions .
Does anybody believe that the intifada can end as long as Israel persists in the occupation of the territories and Palestinians are willing to die in large numbers to deny Israel that privilege ?
Veni , Vidi , Venezuela
FIGHTING tyranny with tyranny clearly did n't work in oil-giant Venezuela last week .
And now coup-plotting military officers and the reinstalled president , Hugo Chavez , need to show Latin America that their tyrannical tactics are at an end .
President Chavez - a former Army coup-meister himself , who was elected three years ago - has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution largely rewritten by himself and his supporters .
He has sometimes talked of remaining president past the year 2020 .
And his economic promises to the poor are in shreds , while his diplomatic flirtation with leftist world dictators only hints at his inclinations to gain more power .
But Latin America has moved beyond coups , and this pivotal nation in a hemisphere of democracies has the means to remove Mr. Chavez by constitutional and especially nonviolent means .
His two-day removal from office began when he tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor .
The company 's executives revolted , threatening a cutoff of oil .
That was a catalyst for pent-up opposition to Chavez .
Business groups and labor unions joined in a giant protest , perhaps knowing that portions of the military were on their side .
When gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace last Thursday , killing more than a dozen , military leaders forced Chavez to step aside .
But then international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez forced the generals to let him take office again .
The Bush administration all but welcomed the coup , tarnishing the US role as a champion of democracy .
It , too , has a reason to repent .
Soldiers Unite To Defend Camp X-Ray
American Marines are bruised by criticism of their treatment of Taliban and al-Qa'eda prisoners , reports Toby Harnden in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba
Before dawn , the prison camp echoes to the voice of the muezzin as the Muslim inmates are called to prayer .
It is 5.17am and Lieut Abuhena Mohammad Saiful-Islam of the US navy is performing his first duty as Camp X-Ray 's chaplin and imam .
" God is great , God is great , " the officer chants in Arabic through a loudspeaker .
" I bear witness that Mohammed is his messenger .
Come to pray , come to success . "
The detainees recite the Koran together , the first of the day 's five prayer sessions .
By mid-morning , they are lounging on mats on the concrete floors of their 8ft-square cages , the blistering sun beating on the tin roofs .
Some hang their towels out to dry in the breeze .
A few call to each other .
Others stand or pace around before slumping again .
A Humvee moves slowly around the perimeter as US Marines , M16 assault rifles at the ready , stand guard .
From seven wooden watchtowers , guards train their weapons on the captured Taliban and al-Qa'eda fighters , who are clad in orange jump suits .
One man is moved back to his cage , his ankles and wrists in shackles .
This is Guantanamo Bay , a sleepy and almost forgotten American outpost of 45 square miles on the eastern coast of Cuba .
Seized by 646 Marines in whaling boats in 1898 during the Spanish-American War , it has been in US hands ever since - Gitmo , for short , or the Pearl of the Caribbean for those soldiers with a sense of humour .
On entering Camp X-Ray , one inmate vowed to kill an American before he left .
Another detainee bit a guard trying to subdue him and , two days ago , another spat on a military policeman .
Such incidents have been rare , however , and most of the camp 's 158 Muslim fanatics are compliant , the guards say .
" They 're just chilling out , that 's exactly what they 're doing , " said Staff Sgt Chuck Albrecht .
" Our guys are pretty dirty .
The detainees are washing every day .
They get granola bars , a box of apple jacks and fresh fruit . "
Like most Marines and MPs making up the 1,200-strong force , Staff Sgt Albrecht is angry at accusations that the detainees have been mistreated .
The Marines live in an encampment 100 yards from Camp X-Ray 's gates .
Some of their tents saw service in the Korean War .
There are holes in them , but for now the problem is the stifling heat .
" The conditions my men live in are very similar to those of the detainees , " said Col Terry Carrico .
The detainees may be shackled , even as they are operated on at the Gitmo hospital , but they have brand new copies of the Koran and Lively Salon anti-dandruff shampoo that promises " a gentle formula to restore moisture to your beautiful clean hair " .
Under the tin roofs , there is wood to absorb the sun 's heat and keep them cool .
Some of the detainees had wrinkled faces , a Marine officer noted .
" We 'll probably be giving them moisturiser next . "
Brig Michael Lehnert said each al-Qa'eda fighter would be given eight to 75 Swiss francs per month - as per the Geneva Convention - if their rank was revealed and PoW status accorded .
They get " culturally appropriate " halal meals .
So do the American soldiers , at Cuba 's only McDonald 's restaurant or the all-ranks bars where popcorn and pizzas are the only fare .
When the detainees wanted water , they got water , said Staff Sgt Monte Webster , an MP .
The camp interpreters had even devised a set of hand signals if a Taliban leader was caught short and needed to use the portable lavatory .
There are jokes at Camp X-Ray but the sense of danger is ever present .
The detainees ' toothbrushes are shortened so that they can not be used as weapons .
During a trial in New York in 1998 , an al-Qa'eda suspect used a comb to stab a prison warder through the eye into his brain .
" Sometimes you 're afraid for your life because these people are trained to kill you , " said Specialist Fabian Rivas .
" They 're willing to give their life to take yours . "
Newspaper coverage of Camp X-Ray in Britain , as relayed by American television and radio , has come close to eroding morale this week .
Specialist Rivas said he ignored the press .
" It 's propaganda .
If I let it get to me I would have a very hard time doing my job . "
Staff Sgt Webster was frustrated .
" It bothers me , " he said .
" We as well as the British have always been the ones who 've been humane .
How could anybody say we 're treating anybody wrong ?
They do n't live it , they do n't see it , so how can they talk about it ? "
Brig Lehnert accepted that the detainees were living in basic conditions but argued that this would improve once permanent facilities were built .
At the camp , Marine engineers saw and hammer away as an interrogation centre and new cages are finished .
The target capacity is 2,000 .
When the detainees look up at a watchtower , they see the Stars and Stripes painted on the front of the sniper 's perch .
A sign pointing to Mecca has just been erected , but the defeated fighters are never allowed to forget that America , their sworn enemy , now controls them .
Military violence constitutes -- in very exceptional circumstances -- a necessary evil in this very imperfect world .
That is a bitter pill to swallow in a thoroughly non-militaristic society such as ours , where the clash of weapons provokes healthy reactions of repulsion .
But unfortunately there is little one can do about it .
Without armed violence the Nazi regime and similar forces that had the wind in their sails in Europe in the 1930s , would not have fallen .
In the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 September , a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out .
The many and often confusing reports we have received over recent weeks on who may be responsible for the attacks already allows a clear pattern to be detected .
The network with which Usama Bin Ladin and his followers tried to destroy the very foundations of the West has ramifications worldwide , vast amounts of money , and thanks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan also a number of excellent training and attack bases .
The fight against the new , transnational terrorism requires an exceptionally broad and committed strategy .
But to build this strategy , targeted attacks on the infrastructure available to Bin Ladin were necessary .
The United States and its principal allies have acted with exceptional caution over recent weeks to the unbelievable provocation of the 11 September attacks .
They took pains to build a broad coalition , and tried to make it clear to their own population and the international community that the enemy is not Islam but a very well defined and perverse interpretation of this religion .
And they placed the stress on the battle of endurance that must follow .
The attacks on targets in Afghanistan that began yesterday [ 7 October ] , remain a risky enterprise .
The coming days will reveal whether or not they were effective , were sufficiently precisely targeted and limited in scope .
That is a clear condition for this first , unavoidable phase in the battle against terrorism to be humanly acceptable .
But they can not be any real talk of success until the broad strategy against terrorism begins to bear fruit .
A strategy that worldwide must include both a degree of repression but most importantly constructive and positive measures .
Whatever the case , we are entering a difficult period .
There is a real danger that the wounded but not yet eliminated network will play its " trump card " and commit further acts of terrorism .
The economic impact of the 11 September attacks was already disastrous , with clear effects on the world economy , hitting the poorest countries by far the most .
The whole operation against terrorism can have positive but also unintentionally negative effects on the international stage .
But we had no choice .
To have sat back with arms folded would have made us all hostages .
The Nippon Foundation revealed that the number of pirates in Southeast Asia attacking ships for ransom is on rise .
During the past several years , pirate attacks have shifted from a " syndicated " crime of attacking large cargo ships to a minor crime of theft or robbery .
However , the foundation warned that the number of pirate attacks , in the new form of sea jacking ships for ransom , has been increasing .
According to the International Maritime Bureau , a civic organ which acts on reports of suspicious shipping movements , piracy , and armed robbery at sea anywhere in the world , the number of pirate attacks in the first half of this year stood 165 , exceeding the record high of 161 pirate attacks in 2000 .
Ninety of the attacks , approximately half of attacks that took place in the world , were reported in Southeast Asian waters .
The most prominent form of such attacks is sea jack for ransom .
In April , in waters off Sumatra Island , an armed group ambushed a cruise ship .
Involved were two employees , of a local company that had merged with an established Japanese oil-related company , and an Indonesian state-run company .
In June , six cases of pirate attacks took place in one day in waters near northern island of Borneo , in which trawl-boats and lumber carriers were ambushed .
In addition , an Indonesian-registered ship was attacked and the crews from two ships , including a captain , were kidnapped and held for ransom .
Among the eight attacks noted above , it was confirmed that a ransom payment was made in five of the cases .
However , negotiations about ransom were not disclosed .
Yoshihiko Yamada , domestic division chief of Nippon Foundation 's Department of Marine Affairs said , " There were very few piracy attacks for ransom on commercial vessels .
A prevailing view is that these piracy attacks are actually committed by anti-government guerrillas amidst mounting political unrest . "
Brazil and Germany call for implementation of Kyoto Protocol by September
Brasilia , 14 ( Agencia Brasil - ABr ) - In a document entitled Partnership Brasil-Germany : Action Plan , both countrires have expressed interest in seeing the Kyoto Protocol take effect by the Sustainable Development Summit ( Rio+10 ) , that takes place in South Africa , next September .
Brazil and Germany also call on other countries to ratify the protocol and work to enforce it .
The document also states that Brazil and Germany intend to expand cooperation in the area of environment and sustainable development .
Both countries expect to present common positions at the Rio+10 meeting .
Finally , the document stresses the importance of the Pilot Program for Protection of Tropical Forests ( PPG-7 ) and German participation in the program .
Geneva Convention applies to Taliban , not Al Qaeda : US
WASHINGTON , Feb 7 : The White House on Thursday declared that the Geneva Convention applies to Taliban forces in the Afghanistan phase of the war on terrorism , but not to Osama bin Laden 's Al Qaeda followers .
" President Bush today has decided that the Geneva Convention will apply to the Taliban detainees but not to the Al Qaeda international terrorists , " Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters .
The move comes after fevered criticism - including from key US allies - stemming from alleged mistreatment of Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees the United States is holding at " Camp X-Ray " in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
" It will not change their material life on a day-to-day basis : they will continue to be treated well because that 's what the United States does , " said Fleischer , who noted neither group would be granted prisoner of war status .
And , " Al Qaeda is an international terrorist group and can not be considered a state party to the Geneva Convention .
Its members therefore are not covered , " by the accord , said the spokesman .
DETAINEES ARRIVE IN CUBA : A new group of 28 prisoners captured in Afghanistan arrived by air on Thursday , bringing the total number of detainees to 186 .
Six of the detainees were transported on stretchers aboard the C-141 cargo flight that left Kandahar , Afghanistan on Wednesday for the 25-hour flight .
Earlier on Wednesday , the US military resumed controversial flights of heavily guarded Al Qaeda and Taliban captives from Afghanistan to a naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , a senior US official said .
The official , who asked not to be identified , told newsmen that the first flight of captives in more than two weeks had left Afghanistan late on Wednesday and was to arrive at the isolated prison camp late on Thursday .
The official did not say how many prisoners were on the flight .
Flights carrying up to 30 of what the Pentagon calls " detainees " were suspended on Jan 23 by defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld pending expansion of outdoor jail facilities at the American base .
A total of 158 captives , whom the Pentagon has refused to classify as prisoners of war , are already being held and interrogated at Guantanamo amid criticism they have not been treated properly under the Geneva Convention .
None has yet been charged with a crime , but Washington has maintained that the prisoners are being treated humanely .
The shackled and blindfolded captives are being flown to Cuba from Kandahar in southern Afghanistan under tight guard and are being housed at the base in 8-by-8-foot cage-like outdoor cells .
The detainees at " Gitmo , " as US soldiers call the base , are of various nationalities .
Saudi officials have said that 100 are from the Gulf kingdom and have demanded they be returned to face justice at home .
Bush said last week he was willing to consider Saudi Arabia 's request on a case-by-case basis but U.S. officials doubted it would happen any time soon .
Moscow , 24 March : Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is departing for Mongolia on Sunday afternoon [ 25 March ] on an official visit , the premier 's press secretary , Tatyana Razbash , told ITAR-TASS .
The official programme of Kasyanov 's stay in capital Ulaanbaatar will begin with a tete-a-tete meeting with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enhbayar on Monday , followed by talks in an extended format and signing of several agreements .
Besides this , the Russian prime minister is scheduled to meet with Mongolian President Natsagiyn Bagabandi and the parliamentary speaker , Sanzhbegiyn Tumur-Ochir .
On Tuesday , 26 March , Kasyanov will address Russian and Mongolian entrepreneurs and visit Science and Technology University .
He is also expected to be awarded the title of honorary doctor of the university .
On Tuesday night , Kasyanov will wind up his Mongolian tour and leave for Vietnam for an official visit .
The turnover of goods between Russia and Mongolia has reached 240m dollars .
Russia exports petroleum products , electricity , machinery and equipment to Mongolia and imports copper concentrate and meat .
Moscow has expressed the wish to import more Mongolian meat .
Russia 's Ambassador to Mongolia Oleg Derkovskiy believes that there are no problems in relations between the two states and the common border stretching for 3,500 kilometres is a border of peace and good neighbourliness .
Moscow and Ulaanbaatar are continuing a political dialogue , actively developing bilateral trade , and consulting each other on international problems where their stands coincide or are close .
At the same time , the ambassador said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that large Russian capital and businesses " are not active enough in dealings with Mongolia " at the moment .
COLOMBO , Sept 16 ( AFP ) - Tamil Tiger rebels launched a flotilla of boats to attack a ferry carrying 1,200 troops in northern Sri Lanka Sunday , hours after an explosive-laden boat tried to ram a navy gunboat in a suicide mission , the defence ministry said .
A cluster of at least 20 boats of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) mounted the pre-dawn attack on the MV Pride of South off the island 's Point Pedro coast , ministry spokesman Sanath Karunaratne said .
He said navy gunboats and helicopter gunships repulsed the initial attack and first reports indicated at least two rebel craft had been blown out of the water .
There were no immediate reports of casualties .
Fighting continued two hours after the initial exchange of fire in high seas and the navy had called in more gun ships to beat back the guerrillas , Karunaratne said .
" The ship had been about 26 miles ( 42 kilometres ) away from Point Pedro when the attack started , " Karunaratne said .
" There are no casualties among the security forces at the moment . "
He said the ship was a regular ferry transporting troops from the northeastern port of Trincomalee to the northern peninsula of Jaffna .
There were 1,200 soldiers aboard the ferry .
Hours before the ferry incident , a navy fast attack craft encountered an explosive-laden boat which blew up in an apparent Tamil Tiger suicide mission , Karunaratne said .
The navy craft had approached the small boat thinking it was in distress as an elderly man , a teenager and another person onboard had put up a white flag .
As it neared the boat , it came under attack .
When the navy vessel retaliated , the fishing boat exploded .
" All three people onboard that boat evaporated , indicating that it was packed with explosives to ram against the navy fast attack craft , " Karunaratne said .
The navy vessel escaped serious damage or casualties .
Tiger guerrillas , leading a campaign for an independent homeland in the island 's northeast , have carried out several attacks against navy and merchant ships , including using boats carrying suicide bombers on more than a dozen naval craft .
The LTTE staged a kamikaze-style assault on a merchant vessel in June last year .
An explosives-laden boat rammed into the bulk cargo carrier , MV Mercs Uhana , as it approached the Jaffna peninsula carrying food and other essentials to the embattled region .
Twenty-one crewmen were rescued , but another seven went missing after the attack .
In September 1999 , the Sri Lankan navy fought Tiger rebel boats off the island 's northeastern coast to prevent the guerrillas from seizing a Chinese merchant vessel .
A Tiger flotilla had been moving towards the 14,000-tonne MV Yugi when it was confronted by navy gun boats , the defence ministry said at the time , adding that the 32 crew members had not been hurt .
The Tigers in August 1997 seized the 6,000-tonne MV Princess Kash off Mullaitivu , on the northeastern coast , while the vessel was taking supplies to private traders in the Jaffna peninsula .
Government forces as well as civilians depend on a vital sea route to Jaffna to provide them with supplies since the land route is held by the Tiger rebels .
Merchant vessels have been warned to operate several miles off the coast to prevent being detected by rebels along the northeastern seaboard .
The navy takes the same route when transporting weapons and troops to Jaffna .
WARTIME After the attacks had occurred , while crisis managers were still sorting out a number of unnerving false alarms , Air Force One flew to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana .
One of these alarms was of a reported threat against Air Force One itself , a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic White House Situation Room that morning .
While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington , by the time Air Force One was airborne at 9:55 A.M. the Secret Service , the President's advisers , and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising against it .
President Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and , at about 10:10 , Air Force One changed course and began heading due west .
The immediate objective was to find a safe location-not too far away-where the President could land and speak to the American people .
The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring down the size of the traveling party .
The President 's military aide , an Air Force officer , quickly researched the options and , sometime around 10:20 , identified Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination .
When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45 , personnel from the local Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield .
The motorcade consisted of a military police lead vehicle and a van ; the proposed briefing theater had no phones or electrical outlets .
Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the President 's remarks , while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security situation with superiors in Washington .
The President completed his statement , which for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live , and the traveling party returned to Air Force One .
The next destination was discussed : once again the Secret Service recommended against returning to Washington , and the Vice President agreed .
Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and control facilities , and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for 50 persons .
The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several days , if necessary .
Air Force One arrived at Offutt at 2:50 P.M. At about 3:15 , President Bush met with his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference .
Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words , " We 're at war , " and that Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said the agency was still assessing who was responsible , but the early signs all pointed to al Qaeda .
That evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending presidential directive they had labored over during the summer .
The secretary of defense directed the nation 's armed forces to Defense Condition 3 , an increased state of military readiness .
For the first time in history , all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United States were grounded , stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country .
Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had been implemented .
The Pentagon had been struck ; the White House or the Capitol had narrowly escaped direct attack .
Extraordinary security precautions were put in place at the nation 's borders and ports .
In the late afternoon , the President overruled his aides ' continuing reluctance to have him return to Washington and ordered Air Force One back to Andrews Air Force Base .
He was flown by helicopter back to the White House , passing over the still-smoldering Pentagon .
At 8:30 that evening , President Bush addressed the nation from the White House .
After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the injured and protect against any further attacks , he said : " We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them .
He quoted Psalm 23- " though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death .
No American , he said , " will ever forget this day .
Following his speech , President Bush met again with his National Security Council ( NSC ) , expanded to include Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and Joseph Allbaugh , the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
Secretary of State Colin Powell , who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks , joined the discussion .
They reviewed the day 's events .
IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME As the urgent domestic issues accumulated , White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten chaired a temporary " domestic consequences " group .
The agenda in those first days is worth noting , partly as a checklist for future crisis planners .
It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the flowing losses to the American economy , such as
Organizing federal emergency assistance .
One question was what kind of public health advice to give about the air quality in Lower Manhattan in the vicinity of the fallen buildings .
Compensating victims .
They evaluated legislative options , eventually setting up a federal compensation fund and defining the powers of a special master to run it .
Determining federal assistance .
On September 13 , President Bush promised to provide $ 20 billion for New York City , in addition to the $ 20 billion his budget director had already guessed might be needed for the country as a whole .
Restoring civil aviation .
On the morning of September 13 , the national airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly improvised security standards .
Reopening the financial markets .
After extraordinary emergency efforts involving the White House , the Treasury Department , and the Securities and Exchange Commission , aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually competitive firms of the financial industry , the markets reopened on Monday , September 17 .
Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal operations .
Evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry and cap its liability .
The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems of protection and preparedness .
Though a number of agencies had some part of the task , none had security as its primary mission .
By September 14 , Vice President Cheney had decided to recommend , at least as a first step , a new White House entity to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of combining them in a new department .
This new White House entity would be a homeland security adviser and Homeland Security Council-paralleling the National Security Council system .
Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush and other advisers .
President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant- Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge-in his address to a joint session of Congress on September 20 .
Beginning on September 11 , Immigration and Naturalization Service agents working in cooperation with the FBI began arresting individuals for immigration violations whom they encountered while following up leads in the FBI 's investigation of the 9/11 attacks .
Eventually , 768 aliens were arrested as " special interest " detainees .
Some ( such as Zacarias Moussaoui ) were actually in INS custody before 9/11 ; most were arrested after .
Attorney General John Ashcroft told us that he saw his job in directing this effort as " risk minimization , " both to find out who had committed the attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack .
Ashcroft ordered all special interest immigration hearings closed to the public , family members , and press ; directed government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were " cleared " of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies ; and ordered the identity of the detainees kept secret .
INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections ; in the chaos after the attacks , it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials , who were following up on other leads .
The clearance process approved by the Justice Department was time-consuming , lasting an average of about 80 days .
We have assessed this effort to detain aliens of " special interest .
The detainees were lawfully held on immigration charges .
Records indicate that 531 were deported , 162 were released on bond , 24 received some kind of immigration benefits , 12 had their proceedings terminated , and 8-one of whom was Moussaoui-were remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service .
The inspector general of the Justice Department found significant problems in the way the 9/11 detainees were treated .
In response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits of the 9/11 detainee program , the Justice Department cited six individuals on the special interest detainee list , noting that two ( including Moussaoui ) were linked directly to a terrorist organization and that it had obtained new leads helpful to the investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
A senior al Qaeda detainee has stated that U.S. government efforts after the 9/11 attacks to monitor the American homeland , including review of Muslims ' immigration files and deportation of nonpermanent residents , forced al Qaeda to operate less freely in the United States .
The government 's ability to collect intelligence inside the United States , and the sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement communities , was not a priority before 9/11 .
Guidelines on this subject issued in August 2001 by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson essentially recapitulated prior guidance .
However , the attacks of 9/11 changed everything .
Less than one week after September 11 , an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act ( officially , the USA PATRIOT Act ) began to take shape .
A central provision of the proposal was the removal of " the wall " on information sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities ( discussed in chapter 3 ) .
Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action , within the limits of the Constitution , to identify potential terrorists and deter additional attacks .
The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26 .
Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States Three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 : ( 1 ) Did any flights of Saudi nationals take place before national airspace reopened on September 13 , 2001 ?
Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals ?
Did the FBI screen Saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure ?
First , we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals , domestic or international , took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of September 13 , 2001 .
To the contrary , every flight we have identified occurred after national airspace reopened .
Second , we found no evidence of political intervention .
We found no evidence that anyone at the White House above the level of Richard Clarke participated in a decision on the departure of Saudi nationals .
The issue came up in one of the many video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired , and Clarke said he approved of how the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency discussion at his level .
Clarke told us , " I asked the FBI , Dale Watson .
to handle that , to check to see if that was all right with them , to see if they wanted access to any of these people , and to get back to me .
And if they had no objections , it would be fine with me .
Clarke added , " I have no recollection of clearing it with anybody at the White House .
Although White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card remembered someone telling him about the Saudi request shortly after 9/11 , he said he had not talked to the Saudis and did not ask anyone to do anything about it .
The President and Vice President told us they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media .
None of the officials we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this matter from any political appointee .
Third , we believe that the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals who left the United States on charter flights .
The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBI 's requirements that passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights departed .
The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart .
The FBI interviewed all persons of interest on these flights prior to their departures .
They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion .
Our own independent review of the Saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed on these flights .
PLANNING FOR WAR By late in the evening of September 11 , the President had addressed the nation on the terrible events of the day .
Vice President Cheney described the President 's mood as somber .
The long day was not yet over .
When the larger meeting that included his domestic department heads broke up , President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top advisers , a group he would later call his " war council .
This group usually included Vice President Cheney , Secretary of State Powell , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , General Hugh Shelton , Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ( later to become chairman ) General Myers , DCI Tenet , Attorney General Ashcroft , and FBI Director Robert Mueller .
From the White House staff , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group , often joined by their deputies , Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten .
In this restricted National Security Council meeting , the President said it was a time for self-defense .
The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks , but also those who harbored them .
Secretary Powell said the United States had to make it clear to Pakistan , Afghanistan , and the Arab states that the time to act was now .
He said we would need to build a coalition .
The President noted that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China .
Secretary Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might have harbored the attackers , including Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , Sudan , and Iran .
He wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with these countries , pointing out that major strikes could take up to 60 days to assemble .
President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September 12 .
In the first meeting , he stressed that the United States was at war with a new and different kind of enemy .
The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre-9/11 work and develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them .
As they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign , they considered a paper that went beyond al Qaeda to propose the " elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life , " an aim that would include pursuing other international terrorist organizations in the Middle East .
Rice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September 13 in the Situation Room to refine how the fight against al Qaeda would be conducted .
The principals agreed that the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm .
The United States would need to integrate diplomacy , financial measures , intelligence , and military actions into an overarching strategy .
The principals also focused on Pakistan and what it could do to turn the Taliban against al Qaeda .
They concluded that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States , it too would be at risk .
The same day , Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage met with the Pakistani ambassador to the United States , Maleeha Lodhi , and the visiting head of Pakistan's military intelligence service , Mahmud Ahmed .
Armitage said that the United States wanted Pakistan to take seven steps :
to stop al Qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical support for Bin Ladin ; to give the United States blanket overflight and landing rights for all necessary military and intelligence operations ; to provide territorial access to U.S. and allied military intelligence and other personnel to conduct operations against al Qaeda ; to provide the United States with intelligence information ; to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts ; to cut off all shipments of fuel to the Taliban and stop recruits from going to Afghanistan ; and , if the evidence implicated bin Ladin and al Qaeda and the Taliban continued to harbor them , to break relations with the Taliban government .
Pakistan made its decision swiftly .
That afternoon , Secretary of State Powell announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had agreed to every U.S. request for support in the war on terrorism .
The next day , the U.S. embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders had agreed to all seven demands .
Pakistan will need full US support as it proceeds with us , " the embassy noted .
Musharraf said the GOP [ government of Pakistan ] was making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would pay a domestic price .
His standing in Pakistan was certain to suffer .
To counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his decisions .
At the September 13 NSC meeting , when Secretary Powell described Pakistan 's reply , President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban .
He also ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the Taliban .
The President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban , step back , wait to see if they got the message , and hit them hard if they did not .
He made clear that the military should focus on targets that would influence the Taliban 's behavior .
President Bush also tasked the State Department , which on the following day delivered to the White House a paper titled " Game Plan for a Political-Military Strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The paper took it as a given that Bin Ladin would continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control .
It therefore detailed specific U.S. demands for the Taliban : surrender Bin Ladin and his chief lieutenants , including Ayman al Zawahiri ; tell the United States what the Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations ; close all terrorist camps ; free all imprisoned foreigners ; and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions .
The State Department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the Taliban : produce Bin Ladin and his deputies and shut down al Qaeda camps within 24 to 48 hours , or the United States will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure .
The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply .
Therefore , State and Defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan .
Both departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence , basing , and other support from countries , according to their capabilities and resources .
Finally , the plan detailed a public U.S. stance : America would use all its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat , punish those responsible for the 9/11 attacks , hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to terrorists , work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks , and avoid malice toward any people , religion , or culture .
President Bush recalled that he quickly realized that the administration would have to invade Afghanistan with ground troops .
But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options were disappointing .
Tommy Franks , the commanding general of Central Command ( CENTCOM ) , told us that the President was dissatisfied .
The U.S. military , Franks said , did not have an off-the-shelf plan to eliminate the al Qaeda threat in Afghanistan .
The existing Infinite Resolve options did not , in his view , amount to such a plan .
All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September 15-16 , as President Bush convened his war council at Camp David .
Present were Vice President Cheney , Rice , Hadley , Powell , Armitage , Rumsfeld , Ashcroft , Mueller , Tenet , Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz , and Cofer Black , chief of the DCI 's Counterterrorist Center .
Tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations .
He proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would join the fight against al Qaeda .
These CIA teams would act jointly with the military 's Special Operations units .
President Bush later praised this proposal , saying it had been a turning point in his thinking .
General Shelton briefed the principals on the preliminary plan for Afghanistan that the military had put together .
It drew on the Infinite Resolve " phased campaign " plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November 2000 as an addition to the strike options it had been refining since 1998 .
But Shelton added a new element-the possible significant use of ground forces- and that is where President Bush reportedly focused his attention .
After hearing from his senior advisers , President Bush discussed with Rice the contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion .
Rice prepared a paper that President Bush then considered with principals on Monday morning , September 17 .
The purpose of this meeting , " he recalled saying , " is to assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism .
It starts today .
In a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting , President Bush charged Ashcroft , Mueller , and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland defense .
President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to deliver an ultimatum to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed .
The State Department was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize Pakistan and to be prepared to notify Russia and countries near Afghanistan when hostilities were imminent .
In addition , Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action in Afghanistan , including the administration 's first Memorandum of Notification on Bin Ladin .
Shortly thereafter , President Bush authorized broad new authorities for the CIA .
President Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David military plan to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the ultimatum .
The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented worldwide .
Finally , he directed Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to craft a plan to target al Qaeda 's funding and seize its assets .
NSC staff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fund-raising by September 18 .
Also by September 18 , Powell had contacted 58 of his foreign counterparts and received offers of general aid , search-and-rescue equipment and personnel , and medical assistance teams .
On the same day , Deputy Secretary of State Armitage was called by Mahmud Ahmed regarding a two-day visit to Afghanistan during which the Pakistani intelligence chief had met with Mullah Omar and conveyed the U.S. demands .
Omar 's response was " not negative on all these points .
But the administration knew that the Taliban was unlikely to turn over Bin Ladin .
The pre-9/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive , National Security Presidential Directive 9 , now titled " Defeating the Terrorist Threat to the United States .
The directive would now extend to a global war on terrorism , not just on al Qaeda .
It also incorporated the President 's determination not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them .
It included a determination to use military force if necessary to end al Qaeda 's sanctuary in Afghanistan .
The new directive-formally signed on October 25 , after the fighting in Afghanistan had already begun-included new material followed by annexes discussing each targeted terrorist group .
The old draft directive on al Qaeda became , in effect , the first annex .
The United States would strive to eliminate all terrorist networks , dry up their financial support , and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction .
The goal was the " elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life .
PHASE TWO " AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein's regime might have had a hand in it .
Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for 11 years , and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in ongoing combat operations .
As a former pilot , the President was struck by the apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting , especially Hanjour 's high-speed dive into the Pentagon .
He told us he recalled Iraqi support for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well .
Speculating about other possible states that could be involved , the President told us he also thought about Iran .
Clarke has written that on the evening of September 12 , President Bush told him and some of his staff to explore possible Iraqi links to 9/11 .
See if Saddam did this , " Clarke recalls the President telling them .
See if he 's linked in any way .
While he believed the details of Clarke 's account to be incorrect , President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at some point , asking him about Iraq .
Responding to a presidential tasking , Clarke 's office sent a memo to Rice on September 18 , titled " Survey of Intelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in the September 11 Attacks .
Rice 's chief staffer on Afghanistan , Zalmay Khalilzad , concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al Qaeda .
The memo found no " compelling case " that Iraq had either planned or perpetrated the attacks .
It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports , including the Czech report alleging an April 2001 Prague meeting between Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer ( discussed in chapter 7 ) and a Polish report that personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad were told before September 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event .
Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak , the memo pointed out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein 's regime .
Finally , the memo said , there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on unconventional weapons .
On the afternoon of 9/11 , according to contemporaneous notes , Secretary Rumsfeld instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible .
The notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking empty training sites .
He thought the U.S. response should consider a wide range of options and possibilities .
The secretary said his instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time-not only Bin Ladin .
Secretary Rumsfeld later explained that at the time , he had been considering either one of them , or perhaps someone else , as the responsible party .
According to Rice , the issue of what , if anything , to do about Iraq was really engaged at Camp David .
Briefing papers on Iraq , along with many others , were in briefing materials for the participants .
Rice told us the administration was concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks .
She recalled that in the first Camp David session chaired by the President , Rumsfeld asked what the administration should do about Iraq .
Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for striking Iraq during " this round " of the war on terrorism .
A Defense Department paper for the Camp David briefing book on the strategic concept for the war on terrorism specified three priority targets for initial action : al Qaeda , theTaliban , and Iraq .
It argued that of the three , al Qaeda and Iraq posed a strategic threat to the United States .
Iraq 's long-standing involvement in terrorism was cited , along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction .
Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz-not Rumsfeld-argued that Iraq was ultimately the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked .
Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq was behind 9/11 .
Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with , " Powell told us .
And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to deal with the Iraq problem .
Powell said that President Bush did not give Wolfowitz 's argument " much weight .
Though continuing to worry about Iraq in the following week , Powell said , President Bush saw Afghanistan as the priority .
President Bush told Bob Woodward that the decision not to invade Iraq was made at the morning session on September 15 .
Iraq was not even on the table during the September 15 afternoon session , which dealt solely with Afghanistan .
Rice said that when President Bush called her on Sunday , September 16 , he said the focus would be on Afghanistan , although he still wanted plans for Iraq should the country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been involved in the 9/11 attacks .
At the September 17 NSC meeting , there was some further discussion of " phase two " of the war on terrorism .
President Bush ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if Baghdad acted against U.S. interests , with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi oil fields .
Within the Pentagon , Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for dealing with Iraq .
Writing to Rumsfeld on September 17 in a memo headlined " Preventing More Events , " he argued that if there was even a 10 percent chance that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attack , maximum priority should be placed on eliminating that threat .
Wolfowitz contended that the odds were " far more " than 1 in 10 , citing Saddam 's praise for the attack , his long record of involvement in terrorism , and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center .
The next day , Wolfowitz renewed the argument , writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator in the 1995 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives-laden plane into CIA headquarters , and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis ' involvement in the attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight .
Given this background , he wondered why so little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots , seeing a " failure of imagination " and a mind-set that dismissed possibilities .
On September 19 , Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked on their contingency plans .
Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the conflict , the references to specific enemies or regions named only the Taliban , al Qaeda , and Afghanistan .
Shelton told us the administration reviewed all the Pentagon 's war plans and challenged certain assumptions underlying them , as any prudent organization or leader should do .
General Tommy Franks , the commanding general of Central Command , recalled receiving Rumsfeld 's guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans meant for his area of responsibility .
He knew he would soon be striking the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan .
But , he told us , he now wondered how that action was connected to what might need to be done in Somalia , Yemen , or Iraq .
On September 20 , President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , and the two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead .
When Blair asked about Iraq , the President replied that Iraq was not the immediate problem .
Some members of his administration , he commented , had expressed a different view , but he was the one responsible for making the decisions .
Franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on military responses in Iraq during the summer before 9/11-a request President Bush denied , arguing that the time was not right .
CENTCOM also began dusting off plans for a full invasion of Iraq during this period , Franks said .
The CENTCOM commander told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi moves shortly after 9/11 , both because he personally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that Saddam might take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern or southern parts of Iraq , where the United States was flying regular missions to enforce Iraqi no-fly zones .
Franks said that President Bush again turned down the request .
Having issued directives to guide his administration 's preparations for war , on Thursday , September 20 , President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session of Congress .
Tonight , " he said , " we are a country awakened to danger .
The President blamed al Qaeda for 9/11 and the 1998 embassy bombings and , for the first time , declared that al Qaeda was " responsible for bombing the USS Cole .
He reiterated the ultimatum that had already been conveyed privately .
The Taliban must act , and act immediately , " he said .
They will hand over the terrorists , or they will share in their fate .
The President added that America 's quarrel was not with Islam : " The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends ; it is not our many Arab friends .
Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists , and every government that supports them .
Other regimes faced hard choices , he pointed out : " Every nation , in every region , now has a decision to make : Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists .
President Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin .
Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda , but it does not end there , " he said .
It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found , stopped , and defeated .
The President had a message for the Pentagon : " The hour is coming when America will act , and you will make us proud .
He also had a message for those outside the United States .
This is civilization 's fight , " he said .
We ask every nation to join us .
President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central Command 's General Franks and other advisers on September 21 and October 2 .
Originally titled " Infinite Justice , " the operation 's code word was changed-to avoid the sensibilities of Muslims who associate the power of infinite justice with God alone-to the operational name still used for operations in Afghanistan : " Enduring Freedom .
The plan had four phases .
In Phase One , the United States and its allies would move forces into the region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan and Pakistan .
This occurred in the weeks following 9/11 , aided by overwhelming international sympathy for the United States .
In Phase Two , air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al Qaeda and Taliban targets .
In an innovative joint effort , CIA and Special Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan faction opposed to the Taliban .
The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October 7 .
The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially secured-after arduous effort-by the end of that month .
In Phase Three , the United States would carry out " decisive operations " using all elements of national power , including ground troops , to topple the Taliban regime and eliminate al Qaeda 's sanctuary in Afghanistan .
Mazar-e-Sharif , in northern Afghanistan , fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U.S. forces on November 9 .
Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul .
By early December , all major cities had fallen to the coalition .
On December 22 , Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun leader from Kandahar , was installed as the chairman of Afghanistan's interim administration .
Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the Taliban .
In December 2001 , Afghan forces , with limited U.S. support , engaged al Qaeda elements in a cave complex called Tora Bora .
In March 2002 , the largest engagement of the war was fought , in the mountainous Shah-i-Kot area south of Gardez , against a large force of al Qaeda jihadists .
The three-week battle was substantially successful , and almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistan 's equally mountainous and lightly governed frontier provinces .
As of July 2004 , Bin Ladin and Zawahiri are still believed to be at large .
In Phase Four , civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task of what the armed forces call " security and stability operations .
Within about two months of the start of combat operations , several hundred CIA operatives and Special Forces soldiers , backed by the striking power of U.S. aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts , had combined with Afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to destroy theTaliban regime and disrupt al Qaeda .
They had killed or captured about a quarter of the enemy 's known leaders .
Mohammed Atef , al Qaeda 's military commander and a principal figure in the 9/11 plot , had been killed by a U.S. air strike .
According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy , the CIA provided intelligence , experience , cash , covert action capabilities , and entrï¿½e to tribal allies .
In turn , the U.S. military offered combat expertise , firepower , logistics , and communications .
With these initial victories won by the middle of 2002 , the global conflict against Islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle .
MOSCOW. May 23 ( Interfax ) - The Russian Aerospace Agency is continuing its active search for a space tourist candidate who would fly to the International Space Station ( ISS ) in autumn , agency director Yuri Koptev told Interfax on Thursday .
The agency has received three official applications for a commercial flight .
A source in space circles told Interfax that the applications came from one Russian citizen , a woman from Australia and one more unnamed person .
In line with established rules , the agency is processing the applications .
In the meantime , two Americans , a singer from the boy group NSYNC Lance Bass and former NASA Associate Administrator Lori Garver , are completing medical examinations at the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow to be okayed for a flight .
At a joint news conference in Moscow this month , Interfax was told that both Americans are expected to announce intentions to fly to space .
The Russian pop group Na-Na has not given up plans for a space flight either .
The singers passed the necessary medical tests last year .
However , the Russian Aerospace Agency told Interfax that it has not received any official applications from either the Americans or the Russian pop group .
It added that there is growing public interest in space tourism around the world , and that it is now seen as a vehicle for increasing personal popularity .
At the moment , the probability of the third space tourist making a space flight this year is 70-80 % , informed sources told Interfax on Thursday .
The set of services related to a taxi mission to the ISS on a Russian spaceship ranges between $ 18 and $ 20 million , agency sources said .
China criticizes US human rights report
BEIJING - China issued its annual report on human rights in the United States on Monday , accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to abuses in its own land while criticizing other countries for theirs .
The report by the Information Office of the State Council , China 's Cabinet , listed evidence of police abuses , poverty , racial discrimination and lack of personal safety in the United States , the official Xinhua news agency said .
It also accused Washington of " wantonly infringing " on the sovereignty of other nations through military operations and stationing US forces overseas , Xinhua said .
The report also slammed US President George W. Bush 's administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases .
China releases the report every year in response to a US State Department report on global human rights conditions , which usually accuses China of widespread abuses .
The US report came out last week .
" Once again the United States , assuming the role of ` world judge of human rights ' has distorted human rights conditions in many countries and regions in the world , including China , and accused them of human rights violations , all the while turning a blind eye to its own human rights-related problems , " the Chinese report said .

Sun Microsystems Inc .
snapping back to profitability after its first quarterly loss as a public firm , said it earned $ 5.2 million , or seven cents a share , in the fiscal first quarter .
Sun , a maker of computer workstations , reported sales of $ 538.5 million for the quarter ended Sept .
up 39 % from $ 388.5 million a year earlier .
In the 1988 period , the company earned $ 20.6 million , or 26 cents a share .
Sun 's results were slightly better than expectations .
Earlier this month , the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $ 530 million .
In a statement , Scott McNealy , Sun 's chief executive officer , said the company 's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April .
One of those new computers , called Sparcstation 1 , accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter , he said .
More than two-thirds of the systems shipped , meanwhile , were products introduced in April .
But problems in manufacturing , forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer .
These problems also resulted in Sun reporting a $ 20.3 million loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30 .
Mr .
McNealy said the issues that hurt Sun 's performance earlier this year are now " largely " behind the firm , and he indicated that Sun 's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year .
Sun also reported a record backlog of orders .
While this indicates continued strong demand for the company 's desk-top computers , Sun faces increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp .
and Hewlett-Packard Co. Recently , analysts have said Sun also is vulnerable to competition from International Business Machines Corp .
which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next year , and Next Inc .

U.S. wants Kyoto dropped from U.N. meet agenda
The United States , having pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol , is now objecting to its implementation in 2002 being mentioned as one of the goals for a global environmental agenda being drawn up at the United Nations .
The United States has demanded that wording on bringing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming into effect in 2002 be excluded from the implementation documentation of a global environmental agenda being drawn up at the third session of the preparatory meeting of the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) , sources said Thursday .
The Kyoto pact grew out of the Conference of the Parties ( COP ) to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change , which itself came out of UNCED .
The United States has pulled out of the protocol , which obliges developed countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , and announced in February a voluntary U.S. plan to slow the growth of global warming gasses .
The latest move , a sign that the United States is stiffening in its attitude toward the pact , will likely draw the ire of other countries , including those in the European Union as well as Japan , which want an early implentation of the Kyoto protocol .
The implementation documents , being drawn up at an intergovernmental meeting at U.N. headquarters in New York , are based on a chairman 's paper announced at the second session of the preparatory meeting in January .
It states how to implement Agenda 21 -- a U.N. global action program for environmental restoration , preservation and social development .
The chairman 's paper stated that the countries will do their best to ensure 1997 Kyoto Protocol is put into effect in 2002 to curb global warming .
It also stated developed countries would give financial and technical support to those countries vulnerable to climate change , such as island nations , and alleviate the global warming 's impact by introducing devices such as satellite observation systems to monitor rising sea levels .
The U.S. government delegation , however , demanded that these statements in the chairman 's paper be reworded to say that countries would tackle climate change in line with the schedule agreed upon at COP7 ( the seventh session of COP ) , which mapped out implementation of the Kyoto Protocol at an appropriate time .
Furthermore , concerning assistance to island countries , although the U.S. delegation agreed to establish satellite observation systems , it demanded that wording about the impact of global warming be deleted .
The delegation said that a causal relation between unusual climatic phenomena and greenhouse gas emissions has not been proved .
The general opinion among other developed countries , however , is that the scientific data is commonly interpreted as linking droughts , floods and rising tides to global warming .
Cabinet OK 's ratification draft
The Cabinet endorsed for Diet approval a bill for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as well as a revision bill on measures to fight global warming .
The bill was submitted to the Diet later that day .
In preparation for ratification , the government has already adopted a framework that would achieve the protocol 's target on greenhouse gas emissions .
After the Diet ratifies the protocol , work will begin on cutting gas emissions .
San Salvador , 17 April ( ACAN-EFE ) -- Salvadorian President , Francisco Flores , today defended his declaration of support for the interim Venezuelan Government headed by industrialist Pedro Carmona , indicating that the information that he had at the time was that Hugo Chavez had resigned the Presidency .
Flores said , in a press conference , that " there is no reason to apologize " to President Chavez , as demanded by Salvadoran opposition parties .
" Our position is very clear , our position was that the new authorities had to receive a vote of confidence to lead the Venezuelan process back to the democratic path , " he stated .
He added " we understood that if there were a civilian who had committed himself to call for elections he should receive a vote of confidence . "
Flores maintained that " this is a position that is not unique to El Salvador ; it is the position of all the European countries , it is the position of the United States ; this is in our view totally reasonable when so little information is available . "
The Salvadorian president considered that the vote of confidence in the provisional government of Carmona will not have any repercussions in relations between El Salvador and Venezuela , which he described as " totally normal , we are not worried in that sense " .
He explained that " El Salvador took a different position " from that of other Latin American countries because at the present time it presides over the Permanent Council of the OAS .
He added that the Latin American countries decided to invoke the OAS Democratic Charter , which implies the investigation all the steps that brought a country to a particular point , and not just simply to determine " if there were a coup d'etat or not . "
He reminded ( the press ) that currently there is an OAS mission in Venezuela with those very objectives .
The commission is headed by Cesar Gaviria , Secretary General of the OAS .
He indicated that the Democratic Charter is a new instrument " and implies that the OAS countries members convene a tribunal " to investigate the case of a country and " decide whether or not to remove it from the international community of which it is part ; " something that " is a tremendously serious process " .
Asked what repercussions an announced visit to Venezuela-by leaders of the opposition party Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN , left wing ) -would have for his government , Flores said that " my concern is that they may be seeking to cause damage to the country . "
The FMLN condemned last Friday the actions against the government of Chavez and celebrated his return to the power on Sunday .
They criticized Flores for not condemning the rupture of constitutional order in Venezuela .
" There is no international problem , but rather a manipulation of the subject domestically ; and once again I want to ask the FMLN that it does not cause damage to this country .
And that in trying to hurt me , it ends up causing damage to the country .
It is necessary to be loyal to El Salvador , " Flores concluded .
uh how do you feel about gun control
uh on the scale they gave one to ten i 'd say i 'm probably a four

Ministry Criticizes 'Odious ' U.S. Report
The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was " surprised , to put it mildly " by the U.S. State Department 's criticism of Russia 's human rights record and objected in particular to the " odious " section on Chechnya .
" One gets the impression that its writers simply used old drafts , as if nothing had happened in either Russia or the United States in recent years , as if the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 had not occurred and the international community had not closed ranks in the battle against terrorism , " the ministry said in a statement .
The State Department 's annual human rights report , which was published Monday , said Russia had a poor record regarding the independence and freedom of the media and in Chechnya .
Russian security forces in Chechnya have " demonstrated little respect for basic human rights and there were credible reports of serious violations , including numerous reports of extrajudicial killings by both the government and Chechen fighters , " the report said .
Russian officials from President Vladimir Putin on down have portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists .
U.S. officials have partially endorsed that view , pointing to rebel leaders such as Shamil Basayev and the Jordanian-born Omar Ibn al Khattab , who are believed to have financial and other ties to Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaida terrorist network .
However , U.S. officials also note that some of the rebels do not have international ties , and they have criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians -- although the criticism was toned down greatly after Russia became an enthusiastic member of the anti-terrorist coalition , sharing intelligence information , opening its airspace to humanitarian flights and giving a green light to U.S. military deployment in Central Asia .
The Foreign Ministry said that the State Department pronouncement on Chechnya reflected the efforts of " certain circles " in the United States that object to the new U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism .
" These circles have persistently tried to reanimate the 'Chechen problem , ' and turn it again into an irritant in the Russian-American dialogue , " the ministry said .
The ministry also suggested that before judging others ' rights records , the United States should investigate the situation at home , including the government 's failure to ratify some international human rights agreements and the use of the death penalty .
Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment , a prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe , in 1996 .

France says time is right for joint US-European action on Mideast
Paris , 10 April : " The conditions are now in place for the United States and the European Union to combine their efforts to work for peace , " the French Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Thursday [ as received - presumably meant to read Wednesday 10 April ] following the Madrid meeting on the Middle East .
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan , the European high representative for the common foreign and security policy ( CFSP ) , Javier Solana , and the foreign ministers of Spain and Russia , Josep Pique and Igor Ivanov , on Wednesday called on Israel to " withdraw immediately " from all Palestinian areas that have recently been occupied and collectively expressed their full support to the Middle East mission US Secretary of State Colin Powell is going to undertake .
" This support will be an asset for Mr Colin Powell , to whom we renew our support in his difficult mission , " according to the communique of the spokesman of the French Foreign Affairs Ministry , Francois Rivasseau .
Bucharest , Feb 28 [ Rompres ] -- The prospects for the construction of a new unit on Russian technology at Romania 's nuclear plant at Cernavoda were sketched out in Moscow during a visit by Romania 's Prime Minister Adrian Nastase on 21 February .
Head of International Cooperation Department of Romania 's Nuclearelectrica Teodor Chirica says that the VVER-1000 technology to be contributed by Russian experts is accepted in the world because is coated for protection and built on US and German supervision and automation systems .
" The Russians have just concluded contracts for the export of four similar reactors , two each to China and India , " Chirica told daily Ziarul Financiar on Thursday [ 28 February ] .
Romania has built the first reactor at the Cernavoda n-plant on Canadian technology , having opted for a CANDU type of reactor instead of Russia 's VVER-4000 .
The second reactor , which is to be commissioned in 2005 , is also built on CANDU technology and estimated to cost $ 700 million to complete .
According to Russian specialists , the VVER-1000 type of reactor would cost some $ 800 million to commission , while Western technology , equipment , and services would cost Romania more than $ 1 billion .
Given the stake at play , namely electricity exports , other countries have also voiced interest in contributing to the finalization of works on reactor III and IV at Cernavoda .
One of these countries is Turkey , a net importer of energy .
On a recent visit to Turkey , Romania 's Prime Minister Adrian Nastase presented his Turkish counterpart Bulent Ecevit the advantages of investments in the plant at Cernavoda , which include a generation price of $ 12/MWh .
The price for the energy generated at Cernavoda is some $ 6 higher than the cheapest energy generated by the water power plants , yet some $ 20 lower than the energy generated by the thermal plants .
STRASBOURG , Nov 29 ( AFP ) -- Three leading international organisations warned jointly Thursday [ 29 November ] that the international fight against terrorism should not be a pretext for the violation of human rights .
The Council of Europe , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said they were responding to recent " worrying developments " in some countries regarding human rights following the September 11 attacks .
" While we recognize that the threat of terrorism requires specific measures , we call on all governments to refrain from any excessive steps which would violate fundamental freedoms and undermine legitimate dissent , " a joint statement issued in Strasbourg , Geneva and Warsaw said .
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson , Walter Schwimmer , Secretary General of the Council of Europe and Ambassador Gerard Stoudmann of the OSCE 's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights said it was essential " that states strictly adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms " in the fight against terrorism .
Robinson , a particularly critical voice in guarding against human rights abuses in the wake of the September 11 attacks , said Wednesday the war on terrorism was taking a heavy toll on civil liberties .
The statement comes two days after the British House of Commons passed emergency legislation allowing the detention of terrorist suspects without trial , and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in a prison uprising in Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan earlier this week .
The killings prompted a call by London-based rights group Amnesty International for an inquiry into the affair .
All three groups said it was essential that governments strike a balance between " legitimate national security concerns and fundamental freedoms that is fully consistent with their international law commitments . "
The statement listed what it said were essential rights that could not be hollowed out because of the fight against terrorism .
These were : the right to life , freedom of expression and religion and freedom from torture , while it also urged that the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes be avoided .
The United States earlier this week hinted it may expand its war against terrorism beyond Afghanistan to Iraq , bringing swift criticism from both Germany and France , who called for restraint in the future of the military campaign .
Govt dismisses US rights report
GOVERNMENT yesterday trashed a US human rights report which lists a number of human rights violations in Namibia at the hands of security forces and Government .
Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute responded that the US government was the worst human rights violator in the world .
Shivute cited the American detention of 300 people at a US naval base at Guantanamo Bay without bringing them to trial .
The US government report on Namibia 's human rights practices for 2001 , released this week , says members of the security forces committed several extra-judicial killings during security operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions during 2001 .
" There were deaths in custody .
The Government did not account for the whereabouts of some persons detained by the security forces .
During arrests and detentions , security force members reportedly tortured and beat citizens who were suspected of complicity with Unita , " the report says .
It also cites cases of arbitrary deprivation of life , disappearance of people , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , arbitrary arrest , and denial of a fair public hearing .
According to the rights report , most of the abuses were perpetrated by Special Field Force ( SFF ) members .
The report says even though the Namibian Constitution provided that people arrested must be informed of the reason for their arrest and be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours of their detention , this has not been the case .
The report charged that many people were arrested on the basis of suspicious links with Angolan rebel movement , Unita , and the Caprivi Liberation Army ( CLA ) .
Many had disappeared without trace .
Retorted Shivute : " The same and worse happened in the United States after the September 11 attacks and with the war in Afghanistan where special camps were built to detain prisoners of war and 'enemies ' of the state .
Would these actions be listed as human rights abuses or is it acceptable because they were committed by the US ?
" Shivute said Namibia attached " little value " to the latest US rights report as it carried a lot of factual inaccuracies and was a " mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports " .
He said the report , for instance , claimed that the Swapo publication Namibia Today , the ruling party paper , was a Government-owned magazine .
Shivute also said the report carried a " total confusion " of historical data by claiming that the National Union of Namibian Workers ( NUNW ) was no longer affiliated to the Swapo Party .
TOKYO , Feb 15 ( AFP ) - Japan Friday welcomed President George W. Bush 's alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gases , but said it will press on with ratification of the pact the US rejected .
" The government of Japan appreciates the announcement of climate change policy by the government of the United States on February 14 as a demonstration of its serious intention to address the issue of global warming , " Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi said in a statement .
The minister however said Japan will press on with ratification of the 1997 Kyoto pact on global warming , which environment ministers from 160 countries -- with the exception of the United States -- agreed on in Morocco last November after marathon talks .
" While the government of Japan intends to take all necessary steps to ensure the approval by the Diet of the Kyoto Protocol as well as the enactment of the required legislation during the current Diet session ... it is important to establish a common rule in future in which all countries including the United States and developing countries participate , " the statement said .
Bush may raise the greenhouse gas matter when he visits Japan for a three-day stay starting Sunday , although Japan 's weakened economy is expected to be the focus of talks .
Bush 's plan , which he revealed in a speech Thursday night , would slow emissions growth by reducing " greenhouse gas intensity " -- the ratio of emissions to economic output -- by a target of 18 percent over 10 years .
The Kyoto pact , which Bush Thursday called " an unsound international treaty " , commits countries to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases to below 1990 levels by a timetable of 2008-2012
June 26 , 1995 Dear Friend :
This is not newsletter .
It is a fund-raising appeal .
But there 's no reason why we should n't share good news at the same time .
Federal , state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing much-needed funding sources for people who are truly in need .
In spite of that , Pleasant Run Children 's Homes , with the help of hundreds of volunteers and others who really care , continues to make a significant impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help .
We all hear about today 's increases in neglect , abuse and abandonment of those who ca n't fight back : children .
Yet few of us hear enough about kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade .
The positive side .
These are special children .
They come into a Pleasant Run program ... whether it 's for therapeutic help in their own homes ( which nurtures whole families ) , through foster care families or in the familial surroundings of our residential homes .
For some , it 's a matter of weeks or months ; for others , it 's years .
They leave Pleasant Run , generally , ready and able to contribute to society .
We 're proud of our children and all that they overcome .
We are a not-for-profit , multi-service agency .
We would n't exist if the need were n't there .
The numbers of children who deserve our services are rising ... as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them .
Please help us help them .
Pleasant Run Children 's Homes ... " where good kids get better .
Sincerely , Mary Roth Tom Hirschauer
Spanish premier , EU leader urge Russia to ratify Kyoto Protocol Text of report by Spanish news agency Efe Barcelona , 14 March : The current president of the EU , Jose Maria Aznar , and the president of the European Commission , Romano Prodi , have handed over a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they urge him to promote the ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change .
In the letter , to which Efe has had access , Aznar and Prodi explain that on 4 March the council of EU environment ministers agreed the adoption of a decision for approval of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on behalf of the European Community .
They explain that this agreement is an important step for the EU in fulfilling the political pledge to achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development .
To this end , Aznar and Prodi report that only the internal ratification processes in each of the member states have now to be concluded and they emphasize that these are at an advanced stage and in some cases have been completed .
" Therefore , we have complete confidence that the instruments of ratification of the European Community and of the 15 member states will be able to be lodged with the Secretariat of the United Nations within the time scale anticipated , in other words , in early June of this year , " they add .
However , the letter emphasizes that for the Kyoto Protocol to be able to enter into force in the near future it is not enough for EU ratification to be guaranteed and they thus urge Putin to ensure that Russia also moves ahead with ratification .
They make this request " convinced of the Russian Federation 's resolute commitment to the Kyoto Protocol " and believing that in this manner the EU and Russia would continue to show the " leadership " which they believe they have shared " with such fruitful results , in international cooperation in the fight against climate change " .
No More Kisses
In light of Secretary of State Albright 's imminent trip to the middle east , the New York Times , Los Angeles Times and Washington Post emphasize the deteriorating situation there .
But USA Today stays with Princess Di .
The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday , she will " read the riot act " to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism .
Her goal will be to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel , telling him that there can be no more attempts at co-opting Hamas , and " no more kisses " of its leaders .
The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context .
Given that the troubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat and Israel , but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Saudi Arabia , the paper states that the U.S. is now facing the prospect that the moderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq and Iran is falling apart .
The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon , dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was ambushed , with twelve deaths the result .
Perhaps the most striking indicator of a change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that cabinet member Ariel Sharon , who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israel entrenched in Lebanon in the first place , is among those urging a reconsideration of the deployment .
Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of its controlling stake of Compuserve , but it 's the Post with the news that AOL is set to take it over .
The Wall Street Journal " Outlook " observes , " In the U.S. job market , the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers , " and states that " the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of corporate downsizing , " which left behind survivors who took stock of career options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land better offers , which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries .
This has led , says the Journal , to annual compensation rising 5-6 percent a year .
Much of the continuing Diana coverage is spinning off into the realm of meta- and meta-meta-pieces .
The LAT , for instance , examines what it takes to be a new " cuddly-feely " Britain born of the national grief experience .
But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as well .
Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwill ambassador job shortly before her death , and USAT reports that Le Figaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her family and children .
Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story .
Not everyone in Calcutta , or India for that matter , is unanimous in praising the nun , whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this collapsing city 's poor neighborhoods .
Salvation -- hers and that of the destitute she rescued from the gutters -- was her aim , not economic or social development as many others understand it , she said .
It 's odd , however , that in repeating this charge , the Times did n't interview the man most closely associated with it , Christopher Hitchens , or refer to the book where he set it out , The Missionary Position .
Hmmm , wan na bet there was a copy of the book on somebody 's desk at the Times though ?
What 's with the top-of-the-front headline the LAT puts over its picture of Martina Hingis standing next to Venus Williams after beating her at the U.S. Open -- " Venus Brought Back to Earth " ?
Does n't that sound like celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory ?
How odd -- and a good illustration of how trying to shoe-horn in a " witty " headline can drive you into an idea that does n't fit or is undeserved .
Given that Ms. Williams' parents are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a still pretty-lilly-white sport , do n't be surprised if there 's a bit of a complaint about this .
Stretching The Case For Inhumanity
Terrorist thugs at Gitmo do n't deserve their treatment
Having had the opportunity to tour Camp X-Ray last week , I offer America 's critics a simple piece of advice : Get a life .
The chronic complainers are outraged by , of all things , the treatment of the captured Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists being detained at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
They have absurdly criticized as " inhumane " the decision to temporarily place prison suits , handcuffs and blindfolds on the terrorists during transfer to protect the military personnel guarding them .
They have even demanded upgraded accommodations , seemingly forgetting that these are the leaders of a worldwide terrorist organization who have repeatedly vowed to kill innocent Americans through war or terror .
Far from being treated inhumanely , the al Qaeda and the Taliban terrorists are better fed , better clothed and better cared for than they would be if they were still roaming the cold caves of Afghanistan .
They eat three nutritious meals a day , including halal , cereal and granola bars .
They enjoy their own large cell , talking freely with one another , worshiping with a prayer leader , and writing home .
Indeed , the evil-doers at Camp X-Ray are getting far better treatment than they deserve - hot showers , a warm Caribbean climate and access to the exact same medical care as the military personnel who live on the base .
It seems our critics would prefer that the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists instead stay at the Ritz-Carlton .
By way of contrast , the men and women of our military who have the extremely dangerous job of guarding these thugs live in 12-person tents , take cold showers using a hose , and often must cope without the benefits of electricity .
They have been away from home for months , and they serve our nation with dignity and honor .
As I toured Camp X-Ray , I stared into the faces of evil .
As I stood just feet away from barbarians who only weeks earlier fired machine guns at American troops , incited bloody prison riots and ambushes and , boasted of plans to kill innocent people , I could not help but feel the grief and anguish of those who lost loved ones on September 11 or during the war in Afghanistan .
I have no doubt that , if given the opportunity , any of the detainees would have relished the chance to kill me .
Indeed , since their arrival at Camp-X-Ray , some of the terrorists have openly threatened the Marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the American people .
There is a greater purpose behind Camp X-Ray than merely detaining these violent enemies of the United States .
At Guantanamo Bay , federal officials are conducting extensive interviews with the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists , culling information on the terrorist network and the whereabouts and future plans of the tens of thousands of terrorists who were trained in the same camps and who are now living around the world .
Already , intelligence gathered from other al Qaeda detainees has uncovered potential plots to attack American embassies , nuclear power plants and public water facilities .
In the caves and hideouts of al Qaeda operatives , we have found instruction books on how to build chemical and biological weapons , detailed maps of American cities and descriptions of landmarks .
The type of work that is occurring at Camp X-Ray may prove critical to preventing a new attack .
President Bush and America deserve appreciation from all corners of the globe for leading the world in the war against terrorism and for making every nation safer .
America 's treatment of the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists at Camp X-Ray is appropriate and , in my opinion , too good for these murderous thugs .
Instead of lecturing the United States , our critics may better spend their time reminding others that if terrorists do n't want to be detained at Camp X-Ray , they should join the civilized world .
Rep. Vito Fossella represents the 13th Congressional District of New York , including Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn .
With international consensus having been reached regarding a treaty to combat climate change , a `` red light '' has been issued to South Korea 's heavily carbon-dependent industries .
Last Saturday , representatives of 165 countries finally agreed on the rules to implement the 1997 Kyoto Protocol after two weeks of negotiations held in Marrakech , Morocco .
According to the accord , about 40 industrialized countries must cut or limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases by an average of 5.2 percent from 1990 levels by 2012 .
Scientists believe these `` greenhouse '' gases ( GHG ) , which mainly result from burning fossil fuels , raise the earth 's temperature and change the climate by creating floods , droughts , and other abnormal weather phenomena .
As South Korea is not included in the Annex I parties , composed of industrialized countries , the accord , which is expected to go into effect some time next year , is not likely to affect the country for a while .
Although a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , South Korea is still regarded as a developing country and is not obliged to reduce its GHG emissions under the treaty .
But considering that South Korea has the highest growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions in the world , it will not be able to fend off international pressure to join in the global campaign to reduce greenhouse gases much longer , experts note .
According to statistics released by International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , a Paris-based agency affiliated with the OECD , South Korea was found to have recorded the highest growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions in 1999 , showing a 75.5 percent increase since 1990 .
In terms of the amount of emissions , South Korea discharged 410 million tons of carbon dioxide in 1999 , ranking tenth in the world .
If industrialized countries start cutting back on GHG emissions from 2008 , when the first target period begins , South Korea will become the seventh most carbon dioxide-producing country in the world , according to IEA figures .
But the government has not taken any concrete steps regarding the cutback of greenhouse gas emissions , maintaining a wait-and-see approach instead .
`` As South Korea has ` developing country ' status , we are not in a position to voluntarily express our course of action , '' said Yoon Jong-soo , director of the global environment office at the Environment Ministry .
`` We estimate Korea will probably join the countries cutting back emissions no later than 2018 .
Until then , we plan to step up efforts to gradually change our energy structure and reduce greenhouse gases by promoting research on renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies , '' he said .
Jun Mu , deputy director of the industry and environment team at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( KCCI ) , said , `` So far , industries have been rather passive in dealing with emission reductions , as is has been something that was considered to lie far off in the future .
`` We will first start gathering the opinions of business leaders regarding Korea 's ratification of the treaty , while continuing to promote the development of energy-efficient technologies , '' he said , adding a special committee on climate change was formed under KCCI last January .
The international treaty to tackle climate change was first envisioned in Kyoto four years ago , but due to the conflicting interests of developed and developing countries as well as other contentious issues such as emission reduction mechanisms and targets , it is yet to go into effect .
The protocol faced danger of being shelved altogether , when the U.S , which is responsible for one-fourth of all CO2 emissions in the world , decided to abruptly withdraw from the climate change treaty last March .
The Bush administration fears the treaty will have a negative effect on its economy and maintains that developing countries , such as China and India , should also be subject to mandatory emission targets .
But due to the strong initiative of the global community , led by the European Union , countries agreed on a set of rules to implement the climate change treaty _ with or without the U.S .
In order for the protocol to be implemented , it must be ratified by at least 55 parties , including enough industrialized countries to represent at least 55 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990 .
A total 43 countries have ratified he treaty so far , with Korea yet to ratify .
The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna
Dear Joe ,
I know what you mean about being a journalist .
Almost every assignment is a challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier .
I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes , so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need .
I think that is why I welcomed doing a book -- it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism .
Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories .
Most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public .
Much of it , of course , using the standards of top newspapers , can not be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating , although it certainly could make for some very good stories .
I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era ( probably decades and decades hence as it is too close ) .
In any case , there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons .
I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur .
So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch .
The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully .
I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man -- at AOL , for example , there was a conscious effort to develop other " characters , " for lack of a better word .
So there , while you think of Case , you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives .
Steve Ballmer , of course , is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft , but it still seems to be Bill 's show over there .
While I did not attend the trial -- I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches , several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing -- it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good .
That 's ironic , since I think it was just that insularity that helped them , much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley .
AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati .
Out in the D.C. area , they looked positively exciting next to all the government-oriented contractors .
I wonder if that means geography is destiny , and it 's still location , location , location .
From where I am sitting , I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age .
I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it 's clear that the balance of power is shifting again , although it not clear where it will land .
Will the strongman of the era be AOL , AT & T , Microsoft , or one of the big media companies ?
Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate ?
I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company -- whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney -- is in charge of all our destinies : Babylon was .
That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire 's grip on humanity .
But we all know how that story turned out .
Now I am getting way too philosophical , but this is my final missive , so why not ?
Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going .
As for me , I 'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and , I guess , life -- nobody knows .
Cheers , Kara
Shuttle Atlantis thunders toward space station
CAPE CANAVERAL - Seven astronauts and a truckload of hardware are racing toward the International Space Station following the successful blastoff Monday of the space shuttle Atlantis .
The launch was the first of six scheduled for the next seven months in a flurry of activity designed to get the space station closer to completion .
Riding three new main engines that belched an orange pillar of fire , Atlantis thundered off the seaside launch pad at 4:44 p.m .
A computer glitch marred the countdown as engineers frantically reloaded software , finishing the job with just 11 seconds to spare .
The launch came after a four-day delay caused when a liquid hydrogen vent pipe sprung a leak during fueling on Thursday .
''You spent a few extra days in Florida , '' NASA launch director Mike Leinbach told Atlantis commander Mike Bloomfield moments before liftoff .
`` But it 's time to take a ride . ''
The launch was a milestone in U.S. space flight .
Mission specialist Jerry L. Ross , a grandfather , became the first astronaut to make seven space flights .
In four space walks during the 11-day mission , astronauts will install the '' keystone '' center support unit for the International Space Station .
The 44-foot-long , 27,000-pound '' S-Zero '' structure 's first job will be to support a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size , stretching more than a football field in length .
As usual , the US State Department published its annual report on human rights practices in world countries last Monday .
And as usual , the portion about China contains little truth and many absurdities , exaggerations and fabrications .
Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish China 's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government , human rights experts said at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights ( CSSHR ) on Friday .
" The United States was slandering China again , " said Xirao-Nima , a professor of Tibetan history at the Central University for Nationalities .
It has no right to issue such a false human rights report , experts said .
" The United States has violated the UN spirit of not interfering in other countries ' internal affairs , " said Jin Yongjian , a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations .
" The United Nations has held the high goal of protecting human rights , " Jin said .
" But it never requested or authorized the United States to compile or release such reports . "
" The United States has completely violated the UN Charter and the principles of relevant international conferences and documents , " he added .
The United States has not only made a procedural mistake , but the facts are incorrect , officials said .
" It somewhat softens its tone in the China human rights report .
But it nevertheless uses human rights issues to slander China , " CSSHR President Zhou Jue said .
" I have been to Tibet many times .
I have seen the truth there , which is very different from what some US politicians with ulterior motives have described , " said Xirao-Nima , who is a Tibetan .
Some Westerners who have been there have also seen the ever-improving human rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region , he added .
After visiting the region several times , Italian senator Renzo Gubert , praised the Chinese Government 's efforts to protect the indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy .
After a visit to Tibet in 2000 , the Italian parliamentary delegation issued a press communique agreeing that the development of Tibet is far better than what has been reported by some Western media .
The central government has built and renovated a number of monasteries .
From 1989 to 1994 , the central government invested 53 million yuan ( US $ 6.4 million ) to repair the Potala Palace .
Later spent another 4.9 million yuan ( US $ 590,360 ) to update the palace 's fire safety facilities .
Renzo Gubert once said that what impressed him most is that local Tibetans enjoy a high level of religious freedom .
The Italian senator 's words are in sharp contrast to what was contained in the so-called China human rights report compiled by the United States , which blindly accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet .
The report uses many unsubstantiated stories to illustrate its unwarranted assertions .
" Throughout the report , there are many doubtful phrases , such as 'according to credible reports ' , 'various sources ' and 'anecdotal evidence , ' to name a few .
It shows that these so-called truths are not true at all , " said Xirao-Nima .
To back up their reckless conclusion , the report lists many incidents where it said religious freedom was violated .
Take the case of Li Guangqiang for example .
The report said China should not have arrested Li , a Hong Kong businessman , who was charged with smuggling Bibles into the country in July .
" His behaviour has violated the Chinese law , " said the Rev Cao Shengjie of the China Christian Council .
Cao said the smuggled Bibles were editions translated by the 'Shouters ' sect .
It is heresy , " said Cao .
" The 'Shouters ' claim they are bigger than Jesus . "
The sect has been banned because of its activities in China in the 1980s .
Cao said to meet the demand of the 15 million Protestants in China , 28 million copies of the Bible , including those printed in ethnic languages , have been printed .
The US human rights report also accuses China of taking advantage of anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic group people living in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region .
It said the United States fears " a spillover from the anti-terrorist campaign in Afghanistan and a perceived opportunity to legitimize measures against the Muslim Uighur activists under the anti-terrorism umbrella . "
" Some US politicians have made a mistake .
Those that want to secede from the nation and engage in terrorist activities are terrorists , not any particular ethnic group , " said Ma Dazheng , director of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region 's Development Research Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .
Whoever engages in terrorism , whether he or she is of Han people or of a minority people , should be brought to the justice , Ma said .
" It is analogous to the US crackdown on terrorists in Afghanistan , " Ma said .
The United States often says that although al-Qaida members and the Taliban are Muslims , US troops are bombing them because they are terrorists , not Muslims , he said .
France 's Chirac says Argentina must make necessary choices
Paris , 2 January : During a telephone conversation on Wednesday [ 2 January ] with the director general of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , Horst Koehler , President Jacques Chirac stressed the need for Argentina to be able to " make the choices " imposed on it by the crisis it is going through .
Reporting on the conversation , Elysee [ presidency ] spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that the head of state had " expressed the hope that the Argentine authorities will know how to make the choices needed for their country 's future " .
" France , like its partners , is in contact with international financial institutions , " the president said , " and is ready to support the action of the IMF with a view to attaining a solution to this crisis . "
Jacques Chirac , Mrs Colonna said , also raised with the IMF director general " the situation of a number of other countries , among them Lebanon in connection with the consolidation of economic reforms in this country , with which France has special ties " !
IMF refuses to help Argentina pay 132 bn USD debt
Argentina was expecting to receive 1.3 billion USD to help the state meet its immediate expenses but after an unfavourable report submitted by Thomas Reichmann , it was decided that now is not " the right moment " to lend any more money .
The IMF has not managed to help Argentina through its current crisis - it has a 132 billion dollar debt to foreign banks and is in its third successive year of recession .
The government this week imposed a restriction on movement of capitals abroad , limiting the sum to 1,000 USD per person .

Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value .
The British chemical and textile company 's plan , which requires shareholder approval , would create a new , listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between # 300 million ( $ 473 million ) and # 400 million , analysts said .
The establishment of the separate company , to be called Courtaulds Textiles , could be effective as early as next year 's first quarter .
Investors welcomed the move .
Courtaulds ' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence , valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion .
Courtaulds ' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders .
Courtaulds ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain , though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC 's plans to spin off roughly # 4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith .
The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31 .
Some analysts have said Courtaulds ' moves could boost the company 's value by 5 % to 10 % , because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined .
In addition , Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities .
Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year .
Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake , Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy .
Even without a specific takeover threat , Courtaulds is giving shareholders " choice and value , " said Julia Blake , an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd .
In a statement , the company said : " Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies .
The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders , customers and employees .
Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff .
BAGHDAD. April 3 ( Interfax ) - Russian companies sold 70 million barrel of Iraqi crude on international markets in the framework of the 11th phase of the UN Oil for Food program .
Russian First Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Ivan Matlashov made this announcement during a bilateral roundtable discussion coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the USSR-Iraq Friendship and Cooperation Treaty .
Russian companies will have exported 118.6 million barrels of oil from Iraq during the six-month phase ending on May 29 , Matlashov said .
During the 10th phase , lasting between June and November 2001 , Russian companies sold 115.3 million barrels .
Russian companies will have sold around 1 billion barrels of Iraqi crude for approximately $ 15 billion during all 11 phases stipulated in the 1996 Iraq-UN memorandum .
This accounts for roughly 40 % of Iraq 's total oil exports , he said .
In April , the UN Sanctions Committee will probably lift restrictions from Russia-Iraq contracts in different spheres valued at about $ 900 million .
The United Nations has allowed the implementation of contracts worth some $ 200 million .
Of this , Russia 's Zarubezhneft foreign trade organization secured 45 contracts valued at about $ 140 million .
Zarubezhneft has shipped $ 45 million worth of equipment and materials in keeping with 33 contracts .
The Iraqi side has pledged to " take into consideration the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry 's recommendations " related to allocation of oil export quotas to its Russian partners .
Russian ship might have missed proper linkup with space station
CAPE CANAVERAL -- ( AP ) -- A Russian supply ship docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday , but may not have latched properly into place .
NASA officials said it was not clear whether the potential problem would delay tonight 's planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour on a station delivery mission .
The concern is that a loose fit might damage the orbiting complex because of the force imparted by a docking shuttle .
The unmanned Progress ship , carrying more than a ton of food , fuel and other supplies , was launched from Kazakstan on Monday .
It pulled up to the space station right on time , and the linkup initially appeared to go well .
But NASA later said Russian flight controllers outside Moscow did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched .
The space station 's steering system , turned off for the docking , remained off an extra three hours to give Russian flight controllers time to study the problem .
Some laboratory equipment and other items were switched off to conserve power .
Everything was turned back on after Russian engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough for the steering system to operate .
Russia 's Mission Control worked into the night to assess the problem .
