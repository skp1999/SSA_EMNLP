i would definitely recommend mary 's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts
i will be going back very soon
best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast
two words free wine
the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied
so garantuan that you ca n't fit them in a toaster
this is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner
if you are a carnivore , come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been
the service varys from day to day- sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on point
one thing i liked about this place is that i never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests
my husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded
all my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was
the atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant
it may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area
le pere pinard has a 15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding
our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal
however , it is jus too good to not praise it
we have been to montparnasse many times and return often for good reason
if you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what rao 's is all about
deep fried skewers are good and still rare to find in nyc
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge )
this restaurant used to be pretty decent
if you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love artisanal !
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it
not impressed with the food
food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food
glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers
the atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe
check it out
first off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her ( odd in a restaurant with 6 tables ) and got our order wrong
our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine
ambiance and music funky , which i enjoy
i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend
try the tandoori salmon !
the service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark
please be aware that it 's cash or amex only !
i had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior
if you 're craving for haru 's great food , especially the house roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their sake bar !
a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees
the food is great
even the wine by the glass was good
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price
we were very pleasantly surprised
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water
they might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says i love you
we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect
planet thai is great !
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food , but my friend who took me there is
ess-a-bagel ( either by sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in ny
i would highly recommend
the service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition
at first i was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of nyc
it 's really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly
also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them
i highly recommend cafe st. bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service
too bad the food was n't of the same heritage
the menu looked good , except for offering the chilean sea bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside
based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for dim sum again
it costs 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice
my girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation
this is as good as neighborhood restaurants come
we will go back every time we are in the city
i have to agree with the previous reviewer
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls
quick and friendly service
authentic bistro !
it 's true , this place is not cheap
it 's convenient
especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals
the waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty
my wife and i always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day
while the menu is n't especially groundbreaking , everything i 've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty
quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried
he not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh
fish was overdone
good food
usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
what a ripoff !
there was a small wait , but shorter than i expected
when going out for a nice dinner , i like a nice ambiance as well as very good food
the music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as i did , i got a whiff of corriander
great bagels made the old-fashioned way
for 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance
great friendly service , fast seating , fast delivery , excellent sushi
as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can
( 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks )
the ambience was nice , but service was n't so great
solid wine list , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever-changing menu keep us coming back
it is thick and slightly soggy
its not the same if you have to sit inside
maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but i 've experienced the same with other restaurants so i do n't appreciate such practice
two people in our party felt like something else , and volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu
wow ! how have i missed this one , tried long tan last week for the first time and now know what the ny times and many more in the neighborhood already knew
the first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland
have been several times and it never dissapoints
our server was very helpful and friendly
try green curry with vegetables
the pad thai is excellent here , as well
big and gawky on the outside
i have been to mary 's many times and i like it
i do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant
this is the best thing in soho
we parked on the block of nina 's the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas
we had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dis h that was great
i think the stuff was better than disney
orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic french food in nyc
the place is a lot of fun
have eaten at ginger house several times , and it 's always good
as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry
during happy hour !
good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers
a guaranteeed delight !
the food was great
anyway , this is the last time i cross the williamsburg
metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with
guess the 555soul ads did n't launch her big modeling career
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
the appetizing is excellent - just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound )
raga stands out with an interesting fusion of french and indian cooking
oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available
the food options rule
we ate here in march , 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight
definately check it out ! ! !
their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , yuck
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine !
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates
i have tried literally every restaurant on curry row
the food is terrible and overall , i would have to say avoid at all costs
unfortunately , the food was not something to get worked up about
i went at pm specifically for the pre-theater menu ( 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get
the large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent
so if you want a nice , enjoyable meal at montparnasse , go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe
i can not imagine better indian food in all of the city
great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! )
very good breads as well
if this happens , just ask for real naan
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money
we always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile
excellent experience
i had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive
what more could you want
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat
the sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp
i 'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good
i love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap
nicky the nose at the bar is a treat
i 'm amazed we have n't been kicked out of this place yet
katz 's has been a nyc original for over 100 years
you can get an excellent meal at most of the many indian restaurants on nearby lexington avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom ( third generation-fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle ( again making it soggy ) and nothingon the rest
everything at sala thai is tasty and well-portioned
great find ! ! !
if only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !
a large is 20 , and toppings are about 3 each
in any event , this is a place i 'll be sure to stop by again when i 'm in this part of town
service is top notch
tends to turn people away
drawbacks service is slow and they do n't toast !
everytime i decide to try another place on the ues , i get angry that i did n't just go to zucchero pomodori
it 's delicious !
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !
if you 're looking for perfect traditional sushi , go here - if you 're looking for interesting combinations , try sushi of gari 's ( east side )
great for large groups and celebrations - our super happy waiter was the entertainment of the evening
ciao bella
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan
it 's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street
taj mahal offeres gret value and great food
i wish i lived there as i would eat at this place as often as possible !
i have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one
service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent ( huge portion ) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared
i had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price rang e , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good
the svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed
they do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating
the sauces used are also not that exciting
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort
i got the 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great
there is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times
the prices are wonderfully low
while they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the bagels , because they among the best in the city
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place
given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary
their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
each bite of food at kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant
you should pass on the calamari
friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece
but people from sichuan will die for it ) - chongqing hot pot , chongqing was the biggest city of sichuan , now became an independent province
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there
while the food was excellent , it was n't cheap ( though not extremely expensive either )
i was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got !
delivery service is great too
they pray to their food gods to make them into a good pizza like vt 's
molto bene !
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips
based on a visit a month ago , i returned the week before christmas and was hugely disappointed
i always get the shabu-shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh
the food is amazing ! ! ! !
having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues
with so many good restaurants on the uws , i do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care
the bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen
filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable
waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan
interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor
the food at this place is 'gourmet ' indian cuisine
if you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount
i do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer
the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices
i almost wanted to write a bad review , so no one would ever go here and i could have all the dumplings to myself !
awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice
this place , however , has a lot less pretension than joya and the thai food is still above-average
the crispy chicken was n't for us , though
in reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby
this place is amazingly bad
compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down
the freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery
price no more than a jersey deli but way better
we went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings !
good french restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at katz ' deli , or mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants
my wife and i were in nyc celebrating our 30th anniversary
not a small feat for good french food in the area
the wine list is interesting and has many good values
decent thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little nolita hangout , but service terrible
most people eat there seem to be typical upper east side snobs , so be aware
the food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared
i brought some buddies from ca and they loved it
sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price
the menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked
the appetizers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar
i 'm sure i 'll return for a final judgement tho
hmmm
it was nice and fresh , but i ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai
overall , worht every penny
i have n't been to the other locations
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though )
meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis
the food was well prepared and the service impecable
but the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished
great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap
authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york
and that 's no mean feat
the signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese
i noted it was crossed off on the bill
needless to say , i 'm never going back and you should be wary too
the food was absolutely amazing ! !
this is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both a-listers and people walking in off the street
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate ( and thank goodness , in my opinion ) but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us
once you become a regular , you are treated as one
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly
the wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town
the waitstaff are all very busy , it 's not outstanding service , but i 've never been dealt with rudely
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( i happen to live in inwood )
they do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money
we just ate at kai and were disapointed
after complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the dish was supposed to taste like
this was my frist time at cafe st. bart 's and i must say how delicous the food and the service was
i do n't get it either
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers
it 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red )
we actually gave 10 tip ( which we have never done despite mediocre food and service ) , because we felt totally ripped off
we will come back ! ! !
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there
this food is asian-air fusion
but on a lazy saturday night , we ended up going
once for dinner and once for brunch
i 've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square
would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago
and i say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner
i have eaten at saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good
more important , the sushi rivals the best in tokyo
they charge 6.00 for rice
you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice
so i thought why not change it up a bit
my picks are - scallion pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - guizhou chicken - shredded squid family style ( one of my personal favorites ) - sichuan spicy soft shell crab - shuizhu fish ( this one is for hardcore sichuan food fans , i would n't recommend to my american friends as it 's very spicy
i really liked the noodle dishes at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish
but for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high
great atmoshere and worth every bit
we had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials
was there friday night
we had a girls ' night dinner here for restaurant week
however , i was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from london noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling
i do n't live in ny but my best friend does
i did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic
after the review i treked into brooklyn
we were pleasantly greeted
great service , great food
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service
it 's the perfect restaurant for ny life style , it got cool design , awsome drinks and food and lot 's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar
to dine at thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside , its so bland on the inside
my friends and i experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer menu at artisanal last night
i have been going back again and again
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude
do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full
the staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
the food was delicious ( i had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch
satisfying
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it
the staff are attentive , and have smiles on their faces
this is the best shabu-shabu restaurant in the try-state area
fish is so very fresh
the decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening
the food was authentic
i only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most nyc italian joints i 've tried similar dishes at
we had reservations at 9pm , but was not seated until
we bring in a party of ten or so every week
not enough wines by the glass either
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful
great wine selection , gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value
at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous
i particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection
for asian fusion , there are many places further downtown
old school meets new world
this is probably one of my new favorite places
for being number 1 , this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation
for myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion , i do prefer smaller , quiter restaurants
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side
they all know you
waitstaff are very friendly
i 've been several times and am totally smitten
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel
service was efficient courteous
this one is definintely my least favorite
while the prices are nothing special , the portions are huge
its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time
the wine list is extensive and impressive
the staff is courteous and friendly
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll
went to village last night for my birthday
some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they 've skipped my order
that 's good and bad
really cool stauff inside
i would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space
be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere ( anywhere )
like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait
seriously , this place kicks ass
it 's just o.k pizza
i loved it and would highly recommend
i 've been here twice now
however , i do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant
i will be returning
warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu !
similar to other indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door
not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a 19.95 all you can eat
shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20
but warning to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations
ok , for all of us growing up in the village of nyc , we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late
so some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise
went last thursday
i love this place more and more everytime i go
we only ordered desserts and drinks , but no refills were offered
we went to ino for valentines
rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in nyc
excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor
based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 pm
horrible
unique apppetizers
the staff has always been attentive and kind , and i 've always been amazed at how they 've handled all the various different group sizes that come in
leave the kids at home !
just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the west village sushi restaurants
great food at reasonable prices
the prices are about 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch
should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it
thank you emilio
the sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great !
the menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size
the food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily
off the beaten path , this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street indian restaurants
the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals
zero ambiance to boot
i ca n't wait for the nex time
the halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( do n't waste any of your calories ) and service was poor
the food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly
i have been in many restaurants all over the city and roth 's steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites
try the spicy shrimp appetizer ( again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price ) and the lamb vindaloo is great
everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends
the staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and i am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it
this restaurant was way overhyped
delicious crab cakes too
now at the top of our list , del frisco 's steakhouse
i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you
not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again , i will certainly stop by
in fact , you ca n't miss it
i recently tried suan and i thought that it was great
a little noise but i think that was because of our party !
it is run by the same sichuan chef who started the chain in chinatown
go here for the drinks !
i do n't get it , what 's so special about prune
do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here
i have eaten at shabu tatsu at least 5 times and i always want to go back for more !
quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair price for nyc
we began with the cheese fondue ( the artisanal blend ) and added apples and kielbasa to dip
even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems
if you want americanized chinese food with your usual watery , generic white sauce , this is your place
a word to the wise - the hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is the cleanest restaurant in town
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in chinese
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic
a little crowded but they move that line really fast !
enjoy ! ! !
the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice
the food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible
the bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that i will never go back
it 's true , you feel like your in a scene from goodfellas
i read the other review and have to say i had the opposite experience here last sunday
the ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere
obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive
still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences
great deal !
stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds ( hint hint )
not only does make the best pizza in ny , maybe anywhere
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale
the wine list is also really nice
for those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more
then , if they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you !
highly recommended to all !
highly recommended
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice
nothing better than buying a snapple for 3.25 too
service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy soho into queens
the service was excellent and the food was delicious
if i wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers i 'd go out in manhattan
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating
when i arrived at orsay i was thrown back , in a veyr good sense
this is the cheers of new york , whether you 've ever been there or not
fine dining restaurant quality
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that
sure , the setting is nice
had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was 55.00 , not including tip
i recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal
the red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal
the flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive , nothing flashy
the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
i liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant
not a great place for family or general dining
their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a 'special ' bagel experience
i thought going to jimmys would give me a real domincan exprience
i have been there many times , and food is good and consistent
i have been a longtime fan of holy basil in the east village , and while i do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality , i have been hesitant to be disloyal
for an untrendy rip-off- eat here
i ca n't wait to go back
i hate hate hate this place
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
it took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses
the sushi is also great !
from the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that i ca n't remember because of the fabulous cakebread cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing
the service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have never been treated rudely
the staff offers impeccable service
the catch is that you are charged extra for anything that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !
this place does n't compare with mamoun 's in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that 's just my opinion
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal
bon appettite ! !
skip dessert
we spent 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed
it was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool
i liked this place the first time but doubt i will ever return
fast service
we a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident
no , really
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time
definitely a once a year treat that i look forward to around the holidays !
my friends and i showed up on a sat
perfect for dates !
the food was boring and expensive
( i 've ordered from the 2nd ave
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
the main course had an average portion , and was decent overall
waitstaff is great , very attentive
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular
in any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back
forget the rush and the wait and the noise ( which is n't actually that bad ) , i mean please , who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic
i would n't mind going back some time , but not before trying others nearby
jimmy is dominican !
when my husband and go there , we spend 60.00 ( have lobster tails ummmmm need i say more ) i ca n't say any more , it a place you 'll never forget if you never go , you 'll miss a meal of your life time
this is also where i was from
average to good thai food , but terrible delivery
and they provided a delicious dessert on the house !
on a recent saturday night , i was with a group of 5 at the bread bar
the price very reasonable
this is , by far , my favorite restaurant in nyc and i only wish it were more affordable so i could go more often !
the frankenstein show was the best
it only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table , but standing up was n't too bad
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -result - we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl
i live a block away and go to patsy 's frequently
we ran a little late for the reservation but it was n't a problem to get our table immediately
i would definitely go back for a very special occasion , but not for regular fine dining
i came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since
i would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not that great
our teenage kids love it , too
the service is not consistently excellent -- just decent
i had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested
unlike other places in nyc where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker , here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion ( and price )
for two people with tip was less than 25 bucks
killer sushi !
staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all
all in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back
they are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch
furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting
they live up to the thai way of living
three page wine menu , one page entree and horedevous
this is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret
the ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca
my host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered
the bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant
overall , not worth the money
we figured we never had argentinian pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent
heartland brewery is a great way to start or finish your day
just straight up cheap , good food
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table
the staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is wonderful !
as a long-time patron of mamoun 's , i always figured that i had found the best late night food spot in the city
edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area
it 's usually packed for good reason , esp
save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to margharita 's on washington street instead , they have amazing food and the best service
they sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion
the service was excellent and the food was delicious
service was also very good
i took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing , really good meal
love the food
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
overall , the best bagel in town
everything a ny pizza joint should be
we go often
the service was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool
great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner
i 've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years i 've been going
food is excellent
if you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable
ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation
make sure you try this place as often as you can
grilled whole fish wonderful , great spicing
plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !
loved it !
village is one of those places that scores on all fronts
the food is good , i ca n't lie
if you live in upper manhattan , siam square is the place for thia food
really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though
complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , i received my dessert on a plate that had happy birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff
little tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in kennsington , honestly the best gnochi i have ever had !
i do not recommend the heartland brewery
their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu
while this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in manhatten 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees
very good wine choices
we will be back
i went to ruby foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth
the price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate
do n't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections
such nice people working here - but i have to review the food
veal parmigana - better than patsy 's !
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as i love la pizza fresca )
what makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in nyc that offers authentic chongqing hotpot
deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area
maybe tomorrow SMILE
please do n't fool us
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chip s-good but a far cry from what the name implies
very different than regular dimsum places
and when i visit her i make it a point to eat at 'ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip
in fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment
want to impress
the selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available
we 've lived in the area for more than 8 years
i grew up on these bagels
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews
after dealing with subpar pizza all over the kensington neighborhood - i 've found little toninos
i went here in the afternoon with a friend
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke
the service was typical short-order , dinner type
but that is highly forgivable
