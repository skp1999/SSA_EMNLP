but the staff was so horrible to us
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora
the food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not
where gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat
for those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all i can say is that they just do n't get it
not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' perks ' were great
it is very overpriced and not very tasty
our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats )
the bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy
nevertheless the food itself is pretty good
i 've noticed megadeth , mr. scruff , st. germain , traditional vietnamese songs , black sabbath , jay-z , and daft punk all being played
they did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ( ie cheese in an omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it
it took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !
the design and atmosphere is just as good
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine
the pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
he ca n't help , they 're bought up so fast
secondly , on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience
obviously run by folks who know a pie
we were very disappointed
it is definitely special and affordable
i really liked this place
all the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
i asked for seltzer with lime , no ice
it was pretty inexpensive too
will not be back
do n't go alone -- -even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods
my suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes
this is n't a value joint
faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery
from the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat
great food at reasonable prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !
look foward to trying the ruben upon returning
the only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to roth 's is the strip house
we usually go to the chart house to celebrate a birthday or anniversary
this little place has a cute interior deco r and affordable city prices
you 'll adore it
the price is reasonable although the service is poor
i have been to roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store
i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a. being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action
raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant
the fried rice is amazing here
three courses - choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious
at the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup
i just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money
the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach
the wine list is excellent
ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before , and toons is by far the best thai food ive had ( except for my mom 's of course )
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another
i highly recommend the sophia pizza
whem asked , we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were
nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends !
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner
fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment
not what i wanted to hear
try the lasagnette appetizer
pricey , but worth a try , at least once
i 've been there a few times , and i usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people
i liked the beer selection !
great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience
ca n't wait to go back
i grew up eating dosa and have yet to find a place in ny to satisfy my taste buds
wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top
with the great variety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored
the menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent
not too crazy about their sake martini
great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in
this place is a great bargain
we happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results
unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits
deff recimmend bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out
we always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied
dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks , swirl them around , and eat
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace
everyone i have spoken too there is super friendly , helpful , and willing to the extra mile for a customer
the pizza was pretty good and huge
sapphire is the only indian restaurant i go to when i 'm in nyc
the cuisine from what i 've gathered is authentic taiwanese , though its very different from what i 've been accustomed to in taipei
i heartily recommend
heartland brewery is by far one of the best places in nyc to make new friends and catch up with old ones
they are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service
we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat
the wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !
this place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps queens ' biggest secret !
this place is so much fun
i was glad i did
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza
i 've never been treated so rudely
i 'll be back soon
went inside and i started to get excited
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order
the strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic
it 's somewhere you can eat and be happy
had we been stalling i could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet !
but overall i give it a 10
though the spider roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them
i have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name
their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for
this was one of the best restaurants i 've ever been to
an oasis of refinement food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new american fine cuisine - chef 's passion ( and kitchen 's precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups
i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it
some baby pizzas get their wish
plenty of choices to make your own creation
it was tiny and i felt like i was eating in someone 's living room
i was there on sat
overall a oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it
vt is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up
from the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible
lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for four dollars
the last time i went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end
nice restaurant overall , with classic upscale italian decor
the entire dining experience was wonderful !
the wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town
service is highly refined our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d ' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress
order the panang duck , it 's fantastic
other than the crappy service from two individuals , it 's great
what more can you ask for
wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment
they have authentic indian at amazin prices
you are treated just like royality
there 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more )
ambiance - relaxed and stylish
i 've never felt more unwelcome than last month at jimmy 's bronx cafe
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon , sea bass and crispy duck
yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right
looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall ( really , that 's what it is )
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs
i look forward to eating here again
i 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste
tuk tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price
a glass of leaping lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy
food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene
the food always tastes fresh and served promptly
i know because i live nearby
the pizza here is delicious
my entire family was horrified
on a monthly basis my friends and i get together and have a girls night out
pizza and garlic knots are great as well , i order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !
for great chinese food nearby , you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away
but who says murray 's is anything about service
i have never been disappointed in the red eye
hats off to the chef
this should have been done in a back room - away from customers
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience
the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's
its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of new york
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table
do n't go
the food was bland oily
but they do
what is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good
the fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary
look i dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place ( please try someother places )
suan has challenged this loyalty
and kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender i have yet to come across
the food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date
it 's a really great deal , considering we got full off of four dollars
went with mommy ( the only person who could afford taking me here )
last time i went here , the waitress did n't come back after taking our order
i am completely hooked on this place , it is ridiculous
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience
granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants
have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town
i love the atmorphere peep !
enjoy !
we were n't !
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed
( la rosa is connected by a swinging door to the mexican restaurant pacifico )
it could have been handled better
the other night we had the 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if i could of licked the plate clean i would of
even after getting pushed out by the no-class famous ray 's , sal has risen again to carry on his father 's uncle 's legacies with a smile , true love for his community , and let 's not forget the outstanding pizza !
it 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early
the environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could
we had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess , it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy
i had the pad thai and the noodles were sticky
so i 've never actually been to m proper , but i 've had it delivered a few times
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money
frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive
succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill
lunch came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge
decent wine at reasonable prices
all conveniently delivered right to the door
nice family owned traditional restaurant
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it
i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world
okay service
the only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service
the food was just awful , atrocious actually
i will never visit this restaurant again
the anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains
the waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food
( or sister , in my case ! )
i 've eaten at many different indian restaurants
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura
try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant
do n't go there !
ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention
good luck getting a table
do n't look down your nose at me like that
the service is awful
just do n't do it
just ignore the trendy wannabes
the takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , i ca n't wait !
trust me , it will be great , and all of it will be devoured in no time
my girlfiends and i ate at o.g again last night
i wish they had one near my office- i would go everyday
finally !
amma has the worst value for money i have experienced in nyc over the past 2 years
i think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated
regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you five minutes
the pizza is good though
bottles of wine are cheap and good
you will not be disapointed at all
walk-ins are risky too
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini
they did n't give us the dinner special until we asked for it
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu
very good service and very good prices
i recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs
our food was great too !
open late ( well as late as i ever got there and i 'm a night person )
the most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue
get your food to go , find a bench , and kick back with a plate of dumplings
please try the filet mignon , its just the most tender piece ever
everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once
we were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it
something about them being busy with holiday party 's
the sake menu should not be overlooked !
this place is great
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm
i 've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they 're that good
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn
went there last night for 2 year anniversery , and was n't all that impressed
it was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us
we were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow
suan was a recommendation that i am glad we heeded
the food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert
we visit at least once a month
it is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise
i 'll keep this short
i felt as though i were eating in paris
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there
however , it 's not worth a special trip
nice value
gigino 's in wagner park is so enjoyable
and it was quick which is very important
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere
the food here does a great service to the name ( cantonese that is )
but , nothing stands out about the cooking
joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere
if that 's a problem , go to mcdonald 's and destroy your insides
the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity and quality )
i 've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city
i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was
i work near-by , and they have the best oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item
always busy but fast moving
sexy
the food was really good , i had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever
i will have to say , this bengali fast food joint is clearly my favorite
i 'm not picky - but it was actually gross
overall , a solid restaurant and at less than 40pp ( including wine ) , a solid deal as well
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get
even with john 's and joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery
when he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- could n't find tonic
the dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of chinese here )
despite the untasteful previous review
do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart
sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know sal , is to know new york
also they were 15 each !
the service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for
my friends spoke so much about it for months , i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree
if you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !
you order from a menu , so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience
one of the more authentic shanghainese restaurants in the us definitely the best in manhattan chinatown
we love th pink pony
so eat fast and order a lot
staff is very accomodating
-- eat club is a roving group of nyc gluttons
if you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance
i went to del frisco 's friday night with my boyfriend for an reservation
if you like sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try yokocho
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date
you ca n't go wrong with this place
very popular style izakaya ( sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes )
hurley 's is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came
not pretentious and very economical
the food was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them
they are tasty , but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system
somewhat pricey but what the heck
try the hot dogs too , they 're snappy and delicious
delivery is fast too
being from the south , there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching foods across america on pbs i found out about katz 's deli
the noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights
highly recommended is the spicy fried clam rolls and spider rolls
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way
thanks bloom 's for a lovely trip
the atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon
oh right , i should probably say something nice
odd for ave b , not just odd , the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least
when we stumbled on leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem but , we were certainly wrong
instead of wasting your time here support restaurants that care about food
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions
just got back from lunch at tamarind and it was excellent
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's
the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around )
try the cheesecake !
as we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were
david , daytona beach , fl
perhaps
great indian food and the service is incredible
go here
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave
rosario 's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence
decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , i expected it to have some type of flavor
we ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich
we generally like good restaurants and eat out often but kai was way to expensive for what we got
what a great place
do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising
for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !
i had the best ravioli ever
ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding
the bill is approximately 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks
the food is great , service is ok
the overall price tag was very very expensive , something i did expect
by the time we were done , it was past
spice is great thai food , love the inexpensive appetizers
read all the other review , they 'll confirm it
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there
the service was attentive
great idea and base for restaurant , but work on the details , people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like
when you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside
we visited bread bar during january restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service
i have been twice to this restaurant
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection
you could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other french bistros
the establishment scores big points in presentation and style
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it
the wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth
the dim sum however was very good
it 's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night
service has always been friendly and efficient
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived
prices are very good
we could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us
fantastic place
plain and simple it 's bad thai food
definitely not a restaurant to skip !
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends
while certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point
the dim sum was so-so , but not spectacular
the food was so-so
the place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention
threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n't be happier
you can do it here
food -awesome
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices
the lobster sandwich is 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price
may , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you
i 've lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all
i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond
the sides were ok and incredibly salty
it hits the spot every time
for some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the salmon
not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy
do n't be fooled by crowds of people
and there 's no way out
the beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out
next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks
please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed
i must say the view of nyc is so beautiful !
if you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , long tan is a good place on the slope
for all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to alphabet city , i say , good - stay out
otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere
highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service
a++ the service was good to excellent along with the attitude
this is my fourth try over a two year period , and i 'm done
the food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass
black white shakes came out good also
it 's simply the best meal in nyc
probably would not go again
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner
the seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here
i ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken
we go on mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to blue ribbon
tuk tuk is my second favorite neighborhood thai place ( the first being joya )
however , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot
this is some really good , inexpensive sushi
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good
i would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too
for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc
also good for client lunch meetings , esp
the decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices
the waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal
the setting is casual and romantic
it was horrible
terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down
the desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced french restaurants
the italian food has flavor ( that can be sort of surprising on the ues ) , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner
i found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish i had
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else
the new york times has reviewed this place three times already , you know it 's going to be good
baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices
emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go
i have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner
moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was very salty !
i came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged
a cheap eat for nyc , but not for dosa
the seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines
pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ( ask for extra rye bread )
really though , where 's the seasoning
the food was just ok , at least for what food was available
by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback ! !
the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes
we did n't even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats
the dinner was ok , nothing i would have again
i love and i know gourmet food by excellence !
i plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta , panini 's
great people watching as others do the same to you
he offers subpar service and has no personality
the waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that 's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd
i 'm going back
diner food at bistro prices is a bummer
my friends and i have been going here regularly for two years
go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby veal calf ( ok bad joke ) , but you will see
while we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation
me and my girls will definitely go back
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven
ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in
all the food was hot tasty
this is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza
would recommend this place as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash
while i 'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business !
this place was not all that !
first of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review
the second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime
much more reasonably priced too !
if you venture off the island of manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great italian restaurant , drive to corona
the food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian
others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten
why make a reservation if you are n't going to keep it
searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli
highly recommended ! ! ! ! !
went here last night and had a pleasant experience
i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend
for 760 for 2 people , it 's a once in a lifetime experience
the food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant
after reading the good reviews of this restaurant , i decided to give it a try with two friends
while the 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in new york city , there is definitely better food in that range , and so sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return
i had been searching really hard for a restaurant in new york where i could really feel unwanted and ignored and i finally found it !
it 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone
well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold
the staff is no nonsense
chinese desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness
wonderful at holiday time
and really large portions
this is a great thai restaurant with a very friendly staff
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday , and i was thoroughly impressed with the food
i recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb
as a japanese native , i 've lived in the tristate area for over 8 years , but i was just so amazed at this place
to give you an idea of how good we thought it was , we ended up going to ping 's three weekends in a row ! ! !
the menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot
in fact , two people could really share one plate
the food is great and authentic
this was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again
love yuka
anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list
go , go , hurry , before everyone finds out about it
prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good
i am bringing my whole family back next time
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing
the photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look
the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny
but the coconut rice was good
it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer
i have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years
overall i would recommend it and go back again
pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here
all of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place
when i 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , i head for cafe st. bart 's
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly
besides , we were on vacation !
i love this cozy around the way rest
quality of food is excellent and price is cheap , stick to pork , fish , chicken , lamb and vegetables
do n't leave without trying one night in tokyo
this is my favorite italian restaurant in all of new york city
the place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty
but , they were too big for the bun
the food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced
a few tips skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards
the bagels are fabulous
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat
the food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great
a great choice at any cost and a great deal
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary
probably much busier for lunch , it 's seldom crowded for dinner ( too close to downtown )
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something ( although they dont forget to charge you for it
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening
saturday , nov. 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us
good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty
first , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which i would have chosen had i known about them
we will be back
also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too
check out the secret back room
it 's also attached to angel 's share , which is a cool , more romantic bar
authentic food and they have real service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door
stick to the gulab jamun
i am amazed by the poor reviews- i find this place to be standout italian in an area flooded with italian- great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list
i was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room
i was a little leary about mary 's at first - it 's small , crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but i 'm glad i finally tried it
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem
also very inexpensive
we 've only eaten in the restaurant once , but we have ordered many times for dinner
i got enough reasons to keep coming back ! ! !
by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar
the food is great and reasonably priced
the characters really make for an enjoyable experience
over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor
the restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese
my husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had
you can not go wrong with this place
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment
prices are in line
the combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in ny
for all of you new to indian food , try the paneer roll , it is a piece of heaven
both the fresh mozzerella slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomenal
i 've been to this monster sushi twice , the 46th st once , the 23rd st one a number of times
it 's constantly open , catering to the pakistani cabbies lined up on crosby st. , so there 's more turnover with the food than you 'd expect ( i.e. , surprisingly fresh )
i had filet mignon with garlic mash
the waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters
go inside and you wo n't want to leave
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the peter 's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad
yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it
have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners
while this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs
the owner truly caters to all your needs
he takes real pride in his food and his business
over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine
i would go back tho
the photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered
too large for just two people but nothing was left
a pleasant surprise
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
if you do n't mind all that noise then go to the chart house
we got most of it back at home with us
get there before 7pm
we were fans of the half-price saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit
so , if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you , which is about 2 inches away , i would say try it
pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta
definitely a neighborhood favorite
my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend
example is the soup which was about 6 oz for 12 dollars and the mushrooms where 12 for about 1oz
service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal
there are other people waiting !
from beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations
ou must try this restaurant
we left , never to return
consistently good japanese tapas
no apologies during restaurant week
my goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing
this place started off a little iffy , but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in nyc ( and i 'm indian , so i should know )
they also do a great job for restaurant week
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently
the dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest i 've ever had )
this is where the aforementioned line was
the food is reliable and the price is moderate
aside from the bearded , courdoroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he 's sleeping with that week , you see a strange mix of hipsters , frat boys , will smith types who need to be told they are black , bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better
i dont how this place is still running
we were in search of food and stumbled on this block of indian restaurants on east sixth street
planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too
very excited to hear that short-term chef jason narone has moved on , he truly was a low point of their sterling track record
well worth the trip , close to city hall and downtown subway stops
all in all , i do n't see how you can go wrong
we recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since i had my yorkie with me
my husband had the mesclun , salmon , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses
we were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our pm curtain call
the food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go
super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz ( the chilaquiles were awesome !
the prices were fantastic
what a great place !
still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house
the table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , i understood they were busy
it 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience )
although , one night we went it was super cheesy , and another night it was less cheesy
even though it is a little loud , you do n't have to yell at each other to talk
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good
it is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner
was surprisingly disappointed
i went to ruby foo 's after work with a group of 6
service was prompt , friendly and great
i have n't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that , the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil
the sushi was awful !
the pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience
late nite omelletes are not good here , there is no variety !
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip
it 's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner
behind this counter , two men are squeezed in
whenever you need a sushi fix , mizu will be there with quality fish and great service
our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there
the website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing
despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful
i definitely would n't go back
it is not worth for that bucks
brick oven gallery is my pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening
for many people , this may not seem like aunthentic thai food because most places in nyc arent quite authentic
growing up in ny , i have eaten my share of bagels
oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
a hearty two thumbs up !
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary
all the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious ! ! !
besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged 45 more than we should have been on our bill
the food now is inconsistent
all pretty good
you can also special order any kind of dumpling , etc
you guys rock
chance is a joke
i was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer
be careful before you request extra spice
the octopus eaters were floored by the octopus salad
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods
i was at rao 's last wed
and the tom kha soup was pathetic
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two
the decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date
service was quick
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like
i was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been going back regularly ever since
went there for an office lunch
i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over 5 years now and i have never been disappointed !
the sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable
we 've been following chef lyle 's food around new york for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return
the best thing i tasted were the lambchops
the spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had
even though its good seafood , the prices are too high
in addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable
upon entering , we were greeted by the owners , steven and frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts
if you live outside the neighborhood , do n't bother !
been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably
meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices
i never had anything i did n't like here
reasonable prices
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration
try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for
it wo n't break the bank but i also wouldnt come back for the food
all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city
i 've been to joya twice and i will never go again
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects
no refills on fountain drinks , though
wow over 100 beers to choose from
be careful of portions - they 're huge
the steak tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal
did i mention the wine
plus , on wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
it is by far my favorite restaurant in brooklyn
now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you
love pizza 33..
even my indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was
i 'm from england , and haru 's was the best i had in nyc
less more in their case
ruby foo 's is a tourist trap
i 've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed
i 've been many time and have never been disappointed
the dim sum servings here are a bit larger than i 'm used to
however , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup
we wo n't go to this place again for a good meal
barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance
we were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant !
after dinner , take your date to the huge dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in ny
has the chef and owner changed
my boyfriend and i recently had an early dinner at artisanal and was satisfied with our experience
i absolutely loved this place
but do n't ever order bacon late at nite ( either platter or in sandwiches , for that matter do n't from any take out place ) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos , hurt my molars
outstanding bagels , but you get what you pay for
pizza - the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
if you 're in town , it 's worth searching for another place
i found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up
they even have a section in the menu called american chinese food !
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together
best italian food i ever had ( and being italian , that means alot )
i will recommend scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful italian food
located at the end of a magnificent block
this restaurant is not worth the time , effort , or money to say the least
looking around , i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen
keep up the good work guys !
hurley 's is terrific !
they do n't walk around with the trays of dim sum
took my sister here before attending a show one evening
great bar , most gorgeous bartenders you 've ever seen ( specifically the blond lady )
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order
really
i really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food
our friends have not arrived yet
they came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant
my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic
the food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish
i had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for 49
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch
the food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service
i usually go there later at night when i get off work so i do n't have to deal with crowds or lines
pizza here is consistently good
we had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations
would n't recomend it for dinner !
sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor
my husband and i enjoy sangria
but after last night , spice grill is the only place i 'm eating indian cuisine
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh
first the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course
not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food , this is one of the best spots
tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes
other apetizers and food
the noodle and rices dishes taste great
the food 's as good as ever
the crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered
i absolutely love this place ! ! !
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard
we had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful
when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort
there are other vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those
if it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which i recommend jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing roast chicken , go to village !
no thanks ! ! !
there was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice
i would definently recommend this restaurant
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo
i love this place !
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials
so much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers
a big disappointment , all around
and its absolutely delicious
no free drink
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent
definitely highly not recommended
do n't waste money on decor
they also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and french with outdoor seatin g - what more could you ask for
go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri
i 'd call it an 'italian dinner '
while the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck
i have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls ' night
have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent
i pray it stays open forever
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it
if you want to save some money , do n't go here
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better
i had the cod with paella ( spicy and very filling , i 'm a big eater and could only eat half ) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips ( again , a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries )
it 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the pink pony can be so ruined by lousy service
this is the first time citysearch did't call it right
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle
try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps
the food portions are really large
the fries are yummy
best taiwanese food in ny !
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst
this place is a great stop for great food
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the city
what for
fantastic !
highly recommended for a first date
we laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , i feel
and the prices were way to high for what you get
skip baroanda down the street ( eurotrashy , snooty and expensive ) and check this place out !
skip this location and go to the one in soho
yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there
the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests
i need at least three rolls to be full , and that 's at least 14.00 !
anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment
all of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank
great wine list , reasonably priced -- sara
the hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale
beef noodle soup is good as well
the food 's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic thai cuisine
i recieved prompt service with a smile
the place was quiet and delightful
best i 've found outside of the chinatown masters
they are amazing !
avoid this place !
the food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes
a must try !
as much as i like the food there , i ca n't bring myself to go back
the prices and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the west village
the soup is pretty good too
it is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in nyc with a week 's notice
i have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats
if you go to roth 's try to be served by mike , he is great ! !
went here on a friend 's reccomendation
not the food , not the ambiance , not the service , i agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out
i love ess-a-bagel , but i live on the west side , so i often go to murray 's for convenience
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
we were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a sunday night
nha trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables
on the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with alain ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity
we will definitely go back
i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of the pizza place at 3am
is just the way it was in days gone by
if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in nyc
the portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic
for the price , you can not eat this well in manhattan
the owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his pizza , you 'll like it !
the atmosphere is great ! ! !
it can be a very fun experience with a group , and kids ( 6 and over ) would love it
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose
the service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful
the atmosphere is n't the greatest , but i suppose that 's how they keep the prices down
the pickles were great addition
if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken , then this is not your place
you must try the shrimp appetizers
not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming
the production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.the food sublime for the most part
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !
it 's like you are transported to the italian countryside , very romantic and filled with antiques
just go and see for yourself
the restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated
i hate this
any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar
whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite
that place was awesome , , , sally !
finally a reliable chinese restaurant !
get over it !
but the thing that my wife and i hated was it was so loud and it felt like ' bar ' or ' pub '
however , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , katz 's has a charm about it
however , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked perrrrrrrrrfect
priced at upper intermediate range
the fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced
i recommend ordering in on a weeknight
try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel
while it 's not nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full
so my husband made up an excuse so we can leave
it 's very spicy but not offensive
they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table
the rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice
they used shredded cheese on top !
they are located in the middle of chinatown !
eating at ottimo is like eating in chef salvatore esposito 's home
katz 's deli is a great ny experience
check it out
the only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable
i could n't reccommend their godmother pizza any higher
i am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great
i was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine ! ! !
i would go again if i did n't have to pay
for the location , the prices are very reasonable
the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre
my friend 's food was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like ( and look like )
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items when i do n't have to rush off to a show
we have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service
hopefully next time , i will save room for dessert
alain ducasse is the best of everything , i mean everything was excelent.i
not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner
the corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth
go here
the best chicken pad tai , i 've ever had
we were n't even at our table for more than an hour total
20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten
it has been my first choice ever since i discovered it
over 100 different choices to create your own
haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on park avenue south and friendly service
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months
very romantic fires - i 've literally spent hours at lanterna , drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience
we got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about
after reading the posts , i was always skeptical to go to the minnow , despite living in park slope
i loved it and will be back soon
always a nice crowd , but never loud
my turkey burger was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw
the service is spotty , sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there
decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend
his drinks are very inventive , delicious and classy
great food , great prices , great service
this is n't your corner chinese food takeout
my husband and i ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com ,
try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !
told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved
uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel ) to get a good taste comparison
we started with lox and mussels ( the best ive ever had , ever ) and had the cod and trout for dinner
just awsome
food is great
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me
i recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
this place is incredibly tiny
i will definetely go back again and again , that 's for sure ! ! !
i did n't complain , i liked the atmosphere so much
this is one of our all-time favorite
the wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread
but when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get
i 've been to several places for dim sum and this has got to be the worst
i love this place
go to volare for 1st class service and terrific food
it 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence
dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time
the people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud
the sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced
the problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair
the fried rice is really good too
we were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager tony gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections
made my dining experience uncomfortable
it 's a steal !
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer
i was with a party of 7 ( close but not next the the front doors ) and we were eating with our coats on
a very inviting restaurant , with friendly service
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden
what 's the difference between the two
i was very disappointed with this restaurant
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced
we also had shared a house salad that was fresh
the ceiling is amazing !
i 'm glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny
and at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water
the space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped
food was average but tasty
we come from new jersey to eat at kinoko
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment
will never be back
the entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired
i highly recommend it
oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great
the pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , i 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places
delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door
my picks guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu )
overall , i 'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its chinatown
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm
my six year old loved it
pizza was a little soggy
the food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers
the singapore mai fun had no curry flavor whatsoever
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent
murray wo n't do it
i 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location
definite go if you 're used to good indian restaurant food from abroad
thr at moshphere is compact , modern , yet cozy
by far , the best pizza in manhattan
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away
worse of all , 60 was erroneously added to our 80 bill
too cold to enjoy
no more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff
try the sea bass
20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality - i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the us that he has been to
inside is a little cramped , but to be expected
during our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks
but they do n't have a toaster , which is strange
so , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out
a must for all the dosa lovers
the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations
the staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table
if you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go
try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! !
of course , it is crowded but who cares
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list
i 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences
people are always friendly
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee ! !
from the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple
service was prompt and courteous
it was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef
chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great
when i called this morning , i did n't think i would be able to get in at 12 , but i was able to get in , along with four other guests
got club soda , filled with ice , no lime
only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant
oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy !
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap
knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks
decent wine selection too
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time
it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here
it 's one of our favorite places to eat in ny
the place does get crowded , so i recommend going between 4-5 pm
disappointing food , lousy service
i 'm from sichuan , this is the restaurant i recommend going
this lovely french-asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on smith street
if you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer
but this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing
over price , and small portions
but i 'd go back
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting
but their best dish is thh thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost 23.95 is most places , but it is 16 here
good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch
my husband said the portions were very small , but if my main cours e was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me
this thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from sripraphai ( another delicious thai restaurant )
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese
perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitude ) lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda
that said , i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best dining experiences i 've ever had
everything about this restaurant was special
because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing
i try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited
while the food was good ( certainly no il mulino ) the service was horrendous
it is expensive but well worth the money
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant
i would recommend reservations on weekends though
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is 1
great pizza for lunch place
the food was very expensive ( we spent 160 for lunch for two ) but extremely tasty
i do n't think i would go again
we were a group of 8 and well seved
i often go there to eat with my family
i wish they would change back to what it was before
no pizza 33 for me !
i love their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken
i 'm no food critic , but i 'd like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years
best dish is nori-wrapped tuna
some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food
an excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time
i went here with my boyfriend and another couple
the staff is also attentive and friendly
the all you can eat deal is truly amazing here
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste
they were such a rip-off ( 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying
first it took us a long time to find the place
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
it is about food and ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine
the food was good too
we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and 4th streets , and joya is the best
immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here
i am a die hard peep lover
the menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them
everyone treats you like you were part of the family
the white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal
the rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats
the menu is nothing like the one on the website
great food , great lay out and awesome service
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away
sea has become so popular that they 've let it go to their heads
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city
oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant arties cafe
( besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city )
my roommate and i love this place
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan
not worth it
in the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , ny crowd
they have it all -- great price , food , and service
so close , but not good enough
this was on a tuesday night
the flavors are great , and the menu is extensive
the food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !
this place has the best interior i have seen anywhere in the northside of w'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there
the food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down
i found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy
and forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either
do n't waste your time , or money ! !
we could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down
sometimes i get good food and ok service
it 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks
this was a great surprise
the food was spicy and delicious
i went with my fiance on a tuesday evening
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite
it was wonderful
went for a late weekday lunch
i just do n't understand all the hype
bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar
anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , i would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari
dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet
although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation
great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work
one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
one of my favorite places in manhattan
they brought glasses and the bottle , and just left the bottle at our table
we were looking forward to nice glass of sangria when we arrived
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window
while we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service ( waiter was not quite competent and slow service ) and lack of remorse
i for one will never patronize them again
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try
the service , however , was a bright flower in a garden
so , again , give it a try
stay far away from this place
we 've been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed
the food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special
a touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed
tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes
we 'd go back again
the location is perfect
guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared
the lunch special is an asbolute steal
nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm
while i quite liked the food and the ambience , i 'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window
i 'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i 've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning
there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience
i have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews i got take out last week
not worth the prices
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just fantastic
service was good and food is wonderful
i only have friends
she gets 10 for her excellent service and advice
please save yourself the frustration
the quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !
( always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer ! ! !
if your visiting , you 'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it 's in time sq
we were on our way back to nj , and since i am in ny , we figured why not grab some food
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective !
and comparing it to the chinatown restaurants is simply not fair
service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money
love the atmosphere - felt like i was in paris
every course was better than the next
not cheap , but not that expensive either
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive
if presentation and service is your thing , then this magic show works
apparently , the good cook works then
i was pleasantly suprised
the yellowtail was particularly good as well
one less manhattanite the better
everyone is welcomed in as family
i ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil
the menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor
spice is sleek , modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff
hey , i think 2+ for a 5 block walk ai n't bad
very affordable and excellent ambient !
look elsewhere
i have never had cheescake like this
bill a little high , but worth it
i seriously doubt i will ever dine at jimmy 's bronx , or for that matter , jimmy 's uptown , again
everyone i bring here always loves it
my co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered
worth a visit
a real dissapointment
its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests
why do people rave about the ambience
were meeting up with some friends for a drink at lafayette 161 and happened to walk by thai angel famished
fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness
great sushi experience
if you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to del frisco 's !
my steak au poivre was one of the worst i 've had
on a recent sunday afternoon , a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread
although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate
the food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour )
from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !
would definitely visit again
definitely worth the trip to battery park city !
perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull
the place was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money
ambience is delightful , service impeccable
service was excellent , and the ac worked very well too ( thank god , it was hot ! )
tasty but expensive
both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand
my friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !
although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take ou t prices are different
the staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely
p.s please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone
to celebrate a birthday , three of us went to mare anticipating great food
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for 8 !
i went to pams with my girlfriend , and i love it
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side
the staff was knowledgeable and full of personality
great staff
only complaint would be that at an average cost of 12- 15 per meal , i 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !
to finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the white chocolate bread pudding with gelato and hot chocolate
the banana tower is an amazing dessert as well
i went there with my friend last saturday
excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service
a cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts
great vibe , lots of people
i like mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , kati rolls just produce tastier food hands down
just an odd group
the service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli , italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night
either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th
i love this place !
it is not consistent
but that was n't the icing on the cake a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had
great food and the prices are very reasonable
wine list is not huge but def well selected
a cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer
the ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service
fresh , authentic , french cuisine in substantial portions
drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon
the one vegetarian entree ( abby 's treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables
at 5 dumplings for 1 , you just can not go wrong
but the pizza is way to expensive
and the staff is also young , energeic and hot ! ! ! !
even better , they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it
service was decent , but not as smooth as i would expect from a place with these prices and reputation
we had a wonderful meal at naples 45 a month ago on a visit to nyc
good drink
great food ( spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom
romantic if you want it to be ( brightly lit )
i recommend it !
i have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in ny and hooked a few new yorkers onto peep as well
enough said !
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily
even though i made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !
we did notice however , that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan
the grilled cheese at home afterwards was better. ! !
the red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside
the food is expensive , but worth every bite
when we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check
in summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of suan ) ! ! !
recommendations , of course , are required !
we did have to wait at the bar for approx
you fellas above says its the best taiwanese restaurant in town
yeah , it 's that good
if you love seafood , you would love this place !
good , fast service
dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty indian restaurant in the upper east side
they charge different prices all the time
i was in love with pongsri on 48th , but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced
i am so coming back here again , as much as i can
it 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisin e
in terms of the food itself -- nothing special , we limited ourselves to several appetizers
love the jazz bands on fri and sat
overall , excellent restaurant !
to begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready
the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly i might add )
the service was ok
i ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it !
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood
but too far east !
highly highly highly recommended !
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation
this place is cool enough to be in the east village , but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry
no dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy midtown
largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !
even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in new york pizza restaurants )
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section
maybe i say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer
this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery - a wasteland we like to call the sliv
now if they could only get a toaster
you will find yourself returning quite often
when he 's not making authentic neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he 's visiting the regulars ( a growing legion ) and checking on newcomers
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !
the ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe 's
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and do n't want to bother going farther for a better place
top spot in town for vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more
less wait time for me !
this was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater
having discovered ping 's on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in
you can not go wrong at the red eye grill
it appears to be the owner 's first venture and it shows
i come from a family of pizzeria owners , and i 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino 's blows my families receipies away
i go twice a month !
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great
the dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet
the worst excuse for japanese food i 've ever encountered
a million better places to go in the city
if celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype
okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland
i ordered a chicken teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry
i love it
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde
we had pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing
its located in greenewich village
there is no excuse for such lousy service !
three strikes and this restaurant is out
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque
so , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious
we would return to this place again !
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible
i must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view
these innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible
just do n't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant , i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there
no gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation
we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait
everything i had was good , and i 'm a eater
one should not go to lucky strike for the food
the service is awful -- the last time i was there ( and i do mean the last time ) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave
we could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue
to me it exemplifies soho , cute , artsy , interesting
try everything for that matter , it is all good
both times we waited well over a half hour for a table ( even though we had reservations )
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone
i 've been eating at taj mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the indian eateries on this block of indian restaurants
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience
try the green curry ! ! !
we were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional
you rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it
the food there are sastifying
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines
i agree
last memorial day , i tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend ( interesting , but )
the food was good
it just was n't thai
i have enjoyed everything i have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way
i love to visit murrays for my bagel fix
we made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire
recommended
the place was nice and calm
cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at 10
i could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out
when we sat , we got great and fast service
most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive
i think locals rate this place so high
service is average
but they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual )
go girls ! ! !
they forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter
the steak is good , the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded
the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald 's than this joint
my gf and i still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi
we ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin
the buffet had a nice selection
this restaurant is such a great place
once you step into cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path parisian bistro
terrible experience
i love the place
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded
will have to return to try the chocolate !
it 's only 1.95 for a regular slice and 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms
there is a real gallery of stars that have visited
the food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no ambience at all
i really enjoyed the shows put on by the actors
i have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn
the miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past
everytime my husband and i go there , we are never disappointed
they are the best bagels i 've had
we were not disappointed
i 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not new yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food
toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space
160 for 2 filets , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks
we arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the past !
however , i think this place is a good hang out spot
the menu is prix fixe , so be prepared to spend at least 60 per person , but it is well worth itsuperb food
rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special
we had the most wonderful waitress
while the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , i have never experienced more incompetency
the quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor
when we left at pm , it was packed and noisy
okay , so i never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning green bo and it 's time to speak up - i live in chinatown
the zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth
never fails to please
decor is nice though service can be spotty
aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks
will absolutely visit again
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar
and even with it 's pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
this big draw is the all you can sushi here for 19.95 !
i consider the best grand sichuan restaurant in nyc
we spent 50 definetly will come back with my friends ! ! !
the specials are usually quite good too
they 've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods
try the chocolate mud cake ( warmed ) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato
while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled
the best burger i have had in the village
we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their 35 menu
came here for restaurant week , did n't save much , but it was still great
would never go back there
three of us arrived for dinner about on a week night without reservations
the blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great
there is usually a wait but it is well worth it
only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited
bring your appetites
the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b * way )
of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways
service was very good and warm
for dinner i had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan
cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc
food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went
also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling
the food is nothing like its menu description
try the pad se-ew or chicken with cashew nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience
the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying
the best place to bring kids or any friends who want to do something different
the service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly
it 's a small cute restaurant
leon is an east village gem casual but hip , with well prepared basic french bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere
the food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other heartland breweries in the city
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu
the food was absolutely horrible !
food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty fresh
restaurant was dirty and unkempt
nice place though
it is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed !
the people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak english , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at
the crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed
the thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !
we 've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we 've been lucky
drinks way over priced
the main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level
what i did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered
moderate prices
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night
try it side by side and there 's no comparison
i think i 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow
my biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair
so sorry i ca n't rate this better
most importantly , food is excellent
buon appetito !
great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no music , kind of quiet
if we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing
however , service was as plain as sesame crusted salmon i had
i would highly recommend it
it 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back
lloovve this place
you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting
finally , after all the raving i went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be
place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic
the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try
other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the food was surprising good !
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn
waiters are slow but sweet
i have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for lunch
the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass
it was good , but was not what i thought it would be
the music is the best among all the indian restaurants i have visited
the bread and lamb chops i had before the meal were quite good , however
he always says , i do n't have customers
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian
good for dates or with friends
they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table
one of the best chicken tikka masala
the kitchen however , is almost always slow
the corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around times square
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again
we had a good time
also , the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected , but a truly above and beyond thing to do
people are rude bit again it 's new york !
we all felt it was worth it
the plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great
service is great , takeout is good too
the pizza is overpriced and soggy
everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city
you 'll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare
for the quality of food , a little too expensive
came looking for this place because i heard good things
i live on the street this place is on
here 's to the fake fish tanks too
its worth the wait though
i 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious
the first time i went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , i ordered the lobster cobb salad
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute
what an amazing meal and experience !
it is the best deal in town for a monday night dinner at a fine restaurant
nothing special about this place
also , the sandwiches ( nearing 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side
and never strayed
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative
this place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else
everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated
and all of that wo n't break your bank !
the thai food is good
great selection of wine , and seafood
delicious
acceptable prices
big thumbs up !
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda
we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant
as i made the title , it 's an affordable restaurant for great taste
they even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little
definitely not worth the price !
orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional french food , and french service as well
it 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal
i ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked thai flavors in unexpected ways
that 's why you have to pay more for that
if you 've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer
i loved it
they 're are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing , queens
and you ca n't beat the prices
but i would n't wan na live there
arigato gozimas yuka !
i had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant
tuk tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in brooklyn
this quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip
i knew upon visiting nyc that i wanted to try an orginal deli
i would highly recommend this place !
total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot
yes , there might be a wait if you have no reservations
first of all dal bukhara rocks
everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food
- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious )
it is terrific , as is the value
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed
( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) we got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another 20 on wine
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well
could be pricey without a prix fixe meal
this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices
one of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it
everyone was more then happy with his choices
again , the waitress was awesome
worth the trip from manhattan
i loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors
the food was just ok , i would never go back
got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full
scalina fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining
i recommend the thai popcorn SMILE
everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people
as soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out
the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed
great neighborhood joint
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent
the only disappointment was the coat check girls who did n't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night ( for the coat check girls )
my fiance took me to scopa last week for my birthday and i could n't believe the food
ummm the beer was cold
i take all my nyc guests to vt 's
it is sometimes a little cramped , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's nyc !
we had great desserts ( including the best cannoli i 've ever had ) and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house
good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe
even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it
we asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty
good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case
however , their popularity has yet to slow down , and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation
where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch
the view is spectacular , and the food is great
the place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and i got our food , the line reached the door
good bagels and good cream cheese
it is also extremely well priced
always great service !
i am happy i did the food was awsome
we ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone
a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks
i went to df for valentines day dinner
i recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab
i loved the shows
and i have been around the block , to say the very least
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu
the aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge
then , get ripped on free box wine
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food
if you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place
the food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere
as there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats , except at taj mahal
also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it
give it a try and enjoy
good food
and that 's saying a lot
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh
the pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian chees e that i 'd never heard of before
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table
if your into thai..you can not miss this great restaurant
going to ballato 's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen , an absolute delight !
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
i think this is one of the more underrated places in the city
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
i go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong , it actually means great prosperity
i think the restaurant was too loud ( when full ) to be romantic
i have had so many dinners here and it 's always been perfect - on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups
when you want a piece of beef , head on over
delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti
incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic thai restaurant
i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse
also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to !
unbelievable
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning !
i 've been living in the columbia university area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens
the menu has lots of options i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes
as soon as i wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how i will be getting to fried dumpling
my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions
i 've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and i 've been sitting there while he lectured another customer
this was the worst dining experience i 've ever had
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna
i thought i had died and gone to heaven
the bruschetta and panini 's are so yummy !
food was okay , nothing great
every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair
i have been going there since it opened and i ca n't get enough
always popular , always full , always a wait
get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 of items bbq-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance
i ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous
if you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share , kai may not be the best option
i 'd definitely recommend this little place
again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here
the first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet
butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere
we had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning
it can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle
we were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la carte
authentic pakistani food
the staff has always been friendly without seeming grating , and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions
get it together
the eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce
service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive
my entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner
in such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great
its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food
in fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and i could n't help telling them that the food was horrible
the bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful
service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , i 'm willing to overlook it
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like
the service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions
an excellent service
the food however , is what one might expect
i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must !
i must give it yon out of yon stars !
the pizza was really good
food is average , and i would say even the chain restaurant baluchi 's tastes better
the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate
kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them
kudos to po !
my boyfriend and i were in ny for a few days and pastis was a place that came recommended
their sushi , kamikaze and other rolls are fresh and well presented
for authentic thai food , look no further than toons
the highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries i received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly 100
i choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent
if anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their wine list
never again !
the only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out
have the iced tea
for park avenue i expected so much more
small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good
so rude
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
they are fast
the food is very good for it 's price , better than most fried dumplings i 've had
there are much better places in ny with better prices
very neighborhoody , very quick and sufficient
everything is delicious , though , my gf and i come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted !
and i could do without the cigar smoke
i 've waited over one hour for food
other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips
the ambience is very calm and quiet
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i 've had at this price range
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit
our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine
the place is a bistro which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city
overall , the ingredients and technique are there and i am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll
though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in
considering their price of 6.25 for lunch specia l , the dish was ridiculously small
this is the pinnacle of indian fast food ( all fast foods in my opinion )
besides , when you have bad service , that 's less money you have to tip
we do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others
i plan on stopping by next week as well
service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat ! ! !
compared to ess-a , tal offers a less doughy bagel !
ballato 's is consistently delicious authentic italian food
the service was attentive , yet discreet
as a retired hipster , i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city
they offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you
we went to eat at the jekyll and hyde restaurant on friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions
unless you are eating in the pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea
you have to increase the service a lot
ambiance is barely romantic but management tries
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal
after we got our sashimi order , i could not believe how small the portions were !
after the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 minutes !
it will be on my to do list the next visit to nyc
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken
the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i 'd drink popcorn topping before i 'd eat another one of these
after a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info
right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city
always fresh and delicious
the food was very good , but not very thai
thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up
the fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
this is a fun restaurant to go to
the mussaman curry that i ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that i ordered in it , they graciously provided me with one piece of poorly cooked potato
had a late night dinner on a saturday night
a restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere
their sake martini is wonderful
well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny
bravissimo ! !
once they ran out of gnochi and made it for me from scratch !
we would like to thank marcelo and grace for a wonderful dining experience ! ! !
found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us
bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
it 's to die for !
cute and decorative
i know this is the case in many nyc eateries , but here , they really cram you in to the point where it 's borderline uncomfortable
overall a disappointing experience for that price category
i 've had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times , when i have been in the neighborhood
the food was exceptional
you will be satisfied
another great place to take out-of-towners !
but , hey , there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in astoria
we were less than impressed
a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner
but still my date was bad
would definitely go back again
i have been to rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better
( and i have eaten my share ) which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve
overall a worthwhile experience
the service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission
it 's really a takeaway place , i would n't sit if i could take it home
the most fun restaurant i have ever been too !
best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
some of the finest latin women you 'll see in your life hang out at jimmy 's
slightly above average wines start at 70+ with only one selection listed at 30+
their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little mayo
and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than 3-6 each )
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything
i had a great experience
the chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce
the waitresses are nice -- also you can just get counter service sit
the only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar
having been a long time ess-a-bagel fan , i was surpised to find myself return time and time again to murray 's
go for it !
highly recommended
you can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb food at reasonable prices , la villa ca n't be beat
wo n't or ca n't is not in the service directory
i can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy
to speak of the park side , words can not describe
saul is pretty good , but definitely not great
i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food
we always get a sampling of appetizers and share
overall i was impressed and will return , it 's a great qpr ( quality to price ratio )
it is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , do not pass it up
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic
the puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !
but 1 for each small piece
our son loves pizza and we have a certified neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant
big and soft as well as good lunch food
no food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food
suan is a great place that i often take my friends ( classmates ) too
as for the bar , this is another bad idea
unlike hh up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for
the barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon , which is just down the street on st. marks and 1st ave
what generous portions !
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy )
i was wrong
the wine the service was very good too
so , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious
the highly spiced chai tea was great too
no plans to return anytime soon
seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town- as everyone says , the spicy tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these , and you 've broken even
there is not a single place in chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city , the food was not what i had hoped for
i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river seine
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about
the meat dishes were only so-so
his wife tanya , the hostess , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious
we liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like balthazar etc
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts
and you 're hungry a few hours later
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth
you do n't go to mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place
the service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and i would not recommend bringing a date here either
monday nights are a bargain at the 28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course
wonderful !
the service is descent even when this small place is packed
this is the best sushi in new york city - hands down
go hungry and enjoy
i have eaten a lot of pizza here
this place is worth an one-hour drive
great value for the quality ingredients
the thali was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and 14.95
truly the mark of an attentive waiter
the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries
the staff is very kind and well trained , they 're fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations
the makhani was ok -- the korma was bland
the food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring
all i can say is wow !
though the service could be better ( possibly due to more than one very large group in the house ) , it is very cordial and warm , as is the general clientele
the decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together
the lox is always fresh too
sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly
service was very friendly
so all i 'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant i 've ever been to
food was ok - fish was cooked well
we actually left hungry and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott street for some good chinese food
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than 18 by just going off the menu
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter
wont come back again for sure !
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family
the place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years , emilio ( the godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices
after being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties ( multiples of 2 and higher ) seated for 40 minutes , the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table
and the bill was outragous
the service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced
kind , attentive wait staff
salads were fantastic
the owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic
la rosa waltzes in , and i think they are doing it the best
the food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries
the food is authentic italian - delicious !
a great addition to smith street finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing ugg boots
it is simply amazing
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing
a great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from costco and sell it right outside for only 2.50
it 's all about the food ! !
skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment
the staff is excellent , specjal that girl behind the bar , european chic
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes
the service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level
always full with tourists ( especially because of it 's close proximity to rockefeller center )
the decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining
this restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced
bravo , blue hill !
conveniently located too , being right on bedford ave
my friends and i came across this place while walking in the village
bottom line b+ for the food , f for the service
the only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave
this place is to be avoided
stick to dimsum , not super overpriced noodles
the service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view
my sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who do n't know what they are doing
we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
at , we were the third party there
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere
i will definetly be going back
the food is good , but very expensive for the casualness of it
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices
i 've been to naples 45 for dinner twice
the hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place ( he painted the ballato 's sign in the window )
try sushimi cucumber roll
i 'm saving up for my next visit
the food is delicious
their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under 30
amma is nothing special
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs
worth it for a special occasion , or any time !
the atmosphere is much better than sripraphai ( more modern and sleek )
i recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady
the food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional
the bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size
i had a late dinner at lucky stike , a great name for a joint if ever i saw one
been there , done that , and new york , it 's not that big a deal
service is fast and friendly
from an english speaking staff
anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice
and they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world !
a defitely must visit
my husband and i enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full
i went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table
we all ate pasta entre'es , which were great
the steak was excellent and one of the best i have had ( i tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat )
great experience overall
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes
the service is ok but could be better
we love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever
nothing against a good sales call , but the tactics at amma are just too obvious
went on a 3 day oyster binge , with fish bringing up the closing , and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended , because it was so great !
took my mom for mother 's day , and the maitre d ' was pretty rude
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte
if the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table
if you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place
however , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual
a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else
i recommend their pad see ew , pork chops or tofu plates
never in my life did i think that i could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for 3.00 in nyc
this is the best secret place in midtown ' , i heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last tuesday
the service was excellent - friendly and attentive
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other
just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait
the dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well
it is what modern cuisine is all about
i definitely will go back
i do n't like indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation
at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven
finally !
having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot
i 've never been disappointed
i wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill
we live in new jersey and whenever we go into new york city we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze ( they told me that if i call in the order , they 'd bring it out to the car so i would n't have to look for parking )
from the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse
jimmy 's is hands down the hottest night spot in the bronx
and i would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their achilles ' heel
my boyfriend and i have been to the minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed
the 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great
nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , francois , and good service
i found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons
the calamari comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yummy as well
i would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard
for some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening , i do n't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area
simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and thats why i checked it out
stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick
i 've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times , but more often i order delivery
we did n't get drink refills and she did n't even offer us the option of dessert
beautiful experience
the bagels are also reasonably priced for nyc
if you can handle that , it 's a great place for a business dinner , fun with friends or simply a table for 2
decor leaves something to be desired
also , specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you do n't
our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food
coming from boston this place is like emma 's pizza in kendall square in cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse
i 've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when i 'm craving for pho , lemon grass chicken or beef cube on rice , this is the place to go
oh yes , and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , i would love to know where they obtained
the food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , ( wow ) you 'll need no more
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead
my fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce
if you are in search of the most authentic nyc deli experience look no further than the famous and historic katz 's deli down on the lower east side
even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good
everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table
the space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise
the entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt
joe 's pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up
i in all reality felt as if i had just gotten off air france and was in the 8th district in paris
i have never had anything like it !
yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited
the food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza
food was very good , but not what i would consider out of this world
i had lobster bisque it has 2 oz of maine lobster in it
i am indian , and i have tried many indian places in ny
try the pad thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
food is great and inexpensive
dessert - ca n't be missed , so save room ! ! !
it can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat
take a good sense of humor , an american express card with no limit , walk out with a lollipop , gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me
it was so bad i actually refused to pay for my food
i recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices
the staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb
i love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them
the pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really made this place was the backyard dining area
the waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large
as a fan of thai , i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst
the service was superb , they treat you like family
we all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , i felt there was more than enough food
the menu may be small , but everything on it is delicious
too bad latin quarters closed
it was divine melts in your mouth
stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and i will be going back frequently
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato ( with espresso ) , which were tasty , but i thought a bit overpriced
when i visited my friend who lives in the upper eastside , she recommended that we go to this restaurant
warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms )
kudos haru
we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.the
i plan on eating here more often
the well mannered , pleasant staff that tony has in his employ
the flavors robust and subtle
all i can say is 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious
the counter service is bad
i had a grat time at jekyll and hyde !
service here was great , food was fantastic
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are
this is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside
and we were thouroughly disapointed
this is the jackel and hideof the restaurants on the ues
the sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect
this is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset
since my first dinner i have had the chance to have brunch at orsay 3x
you will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other chinese and asian fusion places in ny
they have some great entrees here as well
the food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next
you guys are awesome !
they do cater to american palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !
i loved this place ! !
i care more about the food and ambience
oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced )
avoid at all costs
i would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion !
the service is fantastic
i recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon
the garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
food and service was okay
the lamb meat was under-cooked and extrmely chewy
the best pad thai i 've ever had
over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason
great pizza and fantastic service
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date
i would just ask for no oil next time
while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way , the food was insultingly horrible
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read
i really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central
none of that yucky whipped stuff
the wine list is n't great , and the desserts are shipped in from bruno 's down the street , which is not as good as it used to be
i ordered a lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it
their coffee is quite good too !
i would not recommend this place to anyone
great wine list ( italian ) , good food , service was initially fine
despite the fact that the space is large , they 've overcrowded the floor with tables
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience
as far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain
taxan delicious !
perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating
southern indian cuisine is still there , too
restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place
have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience
they could n't even make a salad that was appealing
of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes
and i 've been to many nyc delis
this place is always packed
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you
plus they made a perfect martini
i am not sure if i would call the food here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an indian or exotic touch
i 've eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the cuisine
the waiter was attentive
their margarita is best i 've had since i 've returned from naples !
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night
the tastes makes your mouth water for more
i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband
their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced
the food was actually aweful
after dining at b.o.g over twenty times now , its official !
there is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner
we went around on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
my husband and i both ordered the steak , medium
this place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of japanese classic cuisine
the sushi is average and the prices are anything but
my wife and i also enjoyed the spinach , the shanghai low mein , and other attractions
owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit
turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down
i would go back
definitely will be back !
several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces
i 'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much
if you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here !
the food is consistently wonderful - i 've been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected
i live nearby and when they first opened , i ate there a lot
and the food was fantastic
if you 're looking for a place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls ( hot )
aside from the sea urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail , boton shrimp , blue fin torro ( fatty tuna ) , sea eel , etc
they 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , kenny
while the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate
i 've lived in nyc all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place ( except in a really bad dream )
winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you
you can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !
slightly on the pricey side but worth it !
if it is n't for the food ( a+++ ) , it must be the service or the ambience
during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better
i like the ambience , it 's very dark and original
we were exploring grand central and did n't want to eat in the food court
this place is not worth the prices
we left after one drink
everything that happened was not even up to mediocre
our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy
pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city
you are paying for the atmosphere , which is nice , but can be had in numerous places in bay ridge
it 's called gnochi alla nona and is found under chef specials
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny -- i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish
the fried dumplings are great !
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city
ive been here so many times the waiters know my name
the decor is very simple but comfortable
i 've been frequenting the tasting room since it first arrived in the east village and i 've never been disappointed
the ' kamasutra ' and ' bombay cosmopolitan ' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples
the dim sum here is only so-so
it was raining , and we figured why not
6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled
another welcome addition to the neighborhood
seating is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people
this time , i prefer not to go into detail
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare
service was slow , but the people were friendly
the steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty
my only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you !
and affordable
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret
the food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the steak dish which tends to be dry )
not only would i not recommend jimmy 's restaurants to friends , i would strongly suggest they go anywhere but
they have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody
haru on park s is simply disgusting
the staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check
i drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at scores
the bagel was huge
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else
get the tuna of gari
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing
it was a very nice surprise
the staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often
i am french and i really felt like home ! ! !
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant
service - friendly and attentive
i love going there !
i can not recommend og more highly if i tried - check it out for yourself
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york
service was very prompt but slightly rushed
great food , great decor , great service
and , atlhough tables opened up next to us and we asked for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated
the palak paneer was standard , and i was not a fan of the malai kofta
i 've dined at alain ducasse 's restaurant in monte carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience
yeah , sometimes the service can be slow
there was no ambiance
the service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura
but trust me it is so worth it
it is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in bay ridge
the perfect spot
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 , which makes no sense whatsoever
do not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste
they never came back to refill our glasses again
i would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !
they 're rude at times , and not very friendly
i 'm happy to have nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting
good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress cod e is relatively strict except on fridays
they kindly brought us more to see if it was better , but it was not !
i would highly recommend nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures
all the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews
there 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style
it 's a nice place to relax and have conversation
this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area
best reuben sandwich ever !
lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat
going to volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great italian cook
the sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating ( if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud )
i loved it and would go again
frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side
so so so so so good !
alone for 100 bucks , it is really overprice
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens , this is among the best
very good value
here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid
i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork
i keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table i can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people
it was huge , delicious , fresh , and will be the reason we return
light , refreshing summer rolls ( not fried ) remind me of vietnamese places in paris
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
moral stay away
but the service was a bit slow
spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey
when i saw that their website had a link to da ciro in napoli , i knew there was going to be good pizza !
no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates
indoor was very cozy and cute
we had a 3 hour brunch - they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time
and their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !
they 're terrific ! !
the service is good and the resturant is clean
just stick with the small dishes !
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better
this place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within doyers , right off of pell st ( barber 's alley ) in chinatown
they outshine hh
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great
excellent lunch buffet for only 6.95
we were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past
both are very reasonably priced ( around 8 for dinner and 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling
the portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good
just wish they 'd expand
my boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly !
this was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but i thought that was what made the place so special
good food at the restaurant ( a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date )
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service
you ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown
i have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good
keep up the good work
i was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but i guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place
great eats , good times
for years , i thought tuscan cuisine was the best , but salvatore converted me to the hearty neapolitan fare on my first visit
the service was great as well
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll
another plus is most of the entrees are approx
i will go back to suan soon !
the food was delicious , the atmosphere was relaxed , and we have now adopted plate 347 as our secret on second !
we were pleasantly surprised
from the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed
it is loud , hot and dark
i found the food , service and value exceptional everytime i have been there
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods
the food is definitely good , but i left a bit disappointed
i am a 100 lb girl , had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner , and i was still hungry after my visit to this place !
the drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves
it was wonderful
there is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have major attitude
will give it another chance before i write it off
the all-italian staff is warm and engaging from the start
the prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber
if you go here - your focus should be the tamarind margaritas
it is the best hidden spot there and i rave about it to everyone
the filet mignon dish was superb !
i had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table
ca n't wait wait for my next visit
this place is the most japanese it can ever get
great food , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat !
i did n't expect to like nosh as much as i did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich i had was otherworldly , the soups are like mom 's , and the knishes give yonah schimmel 's a run for its money
the atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most
this place is worth going even if only for their beer
i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto -yum ! )
the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty
do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say
the sandwhiches are out-of-this world !
decor is charming
the food was very well prepared
stay away from this place
good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap
while most people can attest to spending over 50 on drinks in new york bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called , cold and soggy
if you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal
the one up front will smile and say what can i get for you , brother
brava la pizza fresca !
if you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , kai is your place
the prices can not be beat for the quality , quantity , freshness and taste
check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your wallet
if just to drop in , quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over
incredibly poor service an food quality at exorbitant prices
i have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal
i go back in line like three times on average until i ca n't walk anymore
we usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty
horrible food and horrible service
the wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling
bleecker st pizza is the best !
they treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared
the big complaint no toasting available
even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax
volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly
the food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal
the chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites
faan is sooo good
we saw them heating up at least one frozen item though i 'm not sure which dim sum dish it was
no you 're going to go back because the food was good
the food was great and the service was even better
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation
the fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef ( usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt )
consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
i really recommend the very simple unda ( egg ) rolls
i will not be coming here at 3am again
unbelievable
this is the only thai place i go too in nyc , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed jazz on certain nights
we were seated and ignored by waitstaff
if you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here
they showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt
tasty steak , pork loin , the works
i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and did n't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait
i 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service
the burger was great , also
they did give a 15 discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible
just because it 's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !
the pizza was great
and everytime i go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt )
when we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless
kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family
they need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent
i 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer
delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
for appetizers , i recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings
and cheap !
the restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses
try the times square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka ( also available without vodka )
nice find
great wine , great food
the service was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal
the food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to
amazing !
i 've always been seated propmtly
we try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than roth 's we are always disappointed
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives
there is nothing more pleasant than that
i would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again
however , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place
mizu is the japenese find in grammercy
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves
our tiny table for two ( dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic
sake collection was excellent ( try nanbu bijin ) , but pricy
interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauc e and salmon caserole
one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood
ask for usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan
the service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better
the place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh
this is a true gem of the village
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to suan again and again
however , i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once
they treat me like family , morning and night
a wonderful place !
please take my advice , go and try this place
service was on par but not wonderful
for my birthday and we had an excellent time
i went to amma after a friend recommended it
i 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids
we also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them
i 've had the chicken with garlic sauce , chicken with black bean sauce , and hunan chicken
because of the delicate thin crust , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes
i suspect this restaurant is what rao 's would be if it had n't turned exclusive
the dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you , or with the local union worker on the other side
we were then shooed inside
we got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter
it might have been a little too spicy for my friend , which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand
this place is always very crowded and popular
appetizers are somewhere around 7 each and the main dishes are between 11 and 16
really depends on your luck !
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday
my wife and i went to orsay for valentine 's dinner
i do n't know about you guys , but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
i have lived in ny for many years and have dined at many restaraunts
when you enter , you feel like you have entered your mom 's kitchen
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers
i 've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too
i was n't there for the half-price saturday night special , but tuesday night
there was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at pastis
for meetball night
if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you
they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey
get the soup and a nosh ( pastrami sandwich ) for 8 and you 're golden
i have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch - i dont mind
my family and i ate here last night for our annual christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available
the restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must
a one women show !
you ca n't go wrong here
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues
to my right , the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six
in china the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud
i thought this place was totally overrated
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi
you wo n't find that anywhere in manhattan
how do you rate home
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at
interior was so so
i 'm partial to the gnocchi
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they 'd treat us well for the occasion
boy was i wrong !
note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own
we ate outside at haru 's sake bar because haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years
ahhh
better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion
it helps if you know what to order
we shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plat e while i had the sashimi
i ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks
from the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of foods , it was impossible to criticize the food
when we arrived at pm , the restaurant was practically empty
each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles
i am going to the mid town location next
