the bread is top notch as well
i have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the city
food is always fresh and hot- ready to eat !
did i mention that the coffee is outstanding
certainly not the best sushi in new york , however , it is always fresh , and the place is very clean , sterile
i trust the people at go sushi , it never disappoints
straight-forward , no surprises , very decent japanese food
best spicy tuna roll , great asian salad
try the rose roll ( not on menu )
i love the drinks , esp lychee martini , and the food is also very good
in fact , this was not a nicoise salad and was barely eatable
while there 's a decent menu , it should n't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza
once we sailed , the top-notch food and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening
our waiter was horrible so rude and disinterested
the sangria 's - watered down
menu - uneventful , small
anytime and everytime i find myself in the neighborhood i will go to sushi rose for fresh sushi and great portions all at a reasonable price
great food but the service was dreadful !
the portions of the food that came out were mediocre
the two waitress 's looked like they had been sucking on lemons
from the beginning , we were met by friendly staff memebers , and the convienent parking at chelsea piers made it easy for us to get to the boat
we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts
desserts are almost incredible my personal favorite is their tart of the day
i am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places i have tried with higher ratings
maybe the secret was that we went on a sunday night and everything was great
the food was extremely tasty , creatively presented and the wine excellent
we ended up in little italy in late afternoon
we were pleasantly surprised with our choice
the lasagna was probably the best i have tasted
harumi sushi has the freshest and most delicious array of sushi in nyc
i highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine , but also for its friendly owners and staff
if you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy ambiance , this is quite and exquisite choice
i definitely enjoyed the food as well
have always had a great time here
it was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , the food ( from appetizers to entrees ) was delectable
you will be very happy with the experience
the food is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice
how pretentious and inappropriate for mj grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners !
two wasted steaks -- what a crime !
the staff should be a bit more friendly
i absolutely suggest this place
i think the meatball parm is good
if you want good tasting , well seasoned latin food eat at cabana and you ca n't go wrong
definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible
also , the staff is very attentive and really personable
overall , this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time i have been
the gnocchi literally melts in your mouth !
had a great experience at trio staff was pleasant food was tasty and large in portion size - i would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto
entrees include classics like lasagna , fettuccine alfredo and chicken parmigiana
the food is good , the teriyaki i recommend
meal was very expensive for what you get
try the peanut butter sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese !
good food at the right price , what more can you ask for
we love it , and took buses and cabs to get there
if you ' re in new york , you do not want to miss this place
the food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great
i 've been coming here on and off for the past five years and i have to say that la lanterna has never , ever dissapointed me
great food , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all great beer !
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good ( kimono shrimp special was excellent ) and has a great atmosphere
my husband and i moved to nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here , peasant has been our favorite !
the whole experience was satisfying
however , it was worth the visit
the menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced
the food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used
this made it obvious that the food was n't cooked fresh it was obviously made before hand and then reheated
appetizer are excellent here you can make a great ( and inexpensive ) meal out of them
the spicy mussels are a highlight
also get the onion rings -- best we 've ever had
would not return for the amount we paid
however , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the food
huge portions , great and attentive service , and pretty good prices
i was highly disappointed by their service and food
i complained to the waiter and then to the manager , but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up
the food is great and the milkshakes are even better !
stay away if you 're claustrophobic
if you 're in the 'hood , definitely stop in
the mushroom barley soup is amazing
on the recommendation of a friend , i checked out arezzo with my wife
i 'm glad i did as the food was very good and the staff was friendly , courteous and efficient
their duck here is also absolutely delicious
this is definitely one of the places that i have continued to come back to over the years
while it was large and a bit noisy , the drinks were fantastic , and the food was superb
one caveat some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh
i was n't impressed and it was n't spicey
the food was almost always excellent
i was pleasently surprised at the taste
a nice space , as long as it does n't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make mare a great choice for seafood lovers
i never had an orange donut before so i gave it a shot
they really provide a relaxing , laid-back atmosphere
this particular location certainly uses substandard meats
i stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway
the management was less than accomodating
the ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
sandwiches , burgers and salads , like the lemon-dressed cobb , are classic successes
this restaurant is absolutely beautiful
the design is very intimate and romantic
the food was wonderful and imaginative
the staff is very sharp and they look good too
the worst though was the taste
they were dry , stale and pretty flavorless
the fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet
stay with the roasted chickens and you 'll be fine
the atmosphere is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy
the food is great ( big selection , reasonable prices ) and the drinks are really good
the steak melted in my mouth
the food did take a few extra minutes to come , but the cute waiters ' jokes and friendliness made up for it
most importantly , it is reasonably priced
the selection of food is excellent ( i 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants ) , and the atmosphere is great
only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste
food was decent , but not great
i have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked
from the moment you walk in , you feel like you 're in the perfect place
i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food
i find that most kosher restaurants are average to good , but this has been the best i 've eaten so far
the waiters always look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars
the atmosphere is very nice , and a welcome escape from the rest of the si mall
yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food
not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002
i can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at 9 was well worth the money
it was delicious and large !
anywhere else , the prices would be 3x as high !
the service we experienced was friendly and good
our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with
the folding chair i was seated at was uncomfortable
as we waited i watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were
an excellent choice in midtown
service was among the best i have ever had in nyc
the fettucino alfredo was amazing
the food was very good and i was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options
i know real indian food and this was n't it
be sure to try the smoked trout lamb chops , veal chops , rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on
even when the chef is not in the house , the food and service are right on target
everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty
the waiters were very professional , courteous and attentive
my boyfriend and i went here last night and loved it !
the falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine
i highly reccomend the grand marnier shrimp , it 's insanely good
we been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great food , and the service was really good
desserts include flan and sopaipillas
i was starving and the small portions were driving me crazy !
the wait staff was loud and inconsiderate
however , the food and service and dramatically lacking
the sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone
the service is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot
it had been awhile and i forgot just how delicious crepes can be
montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip
my friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend
i had a delicious shrimp creole
the chicken dinner was real good
beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth
the decor is designed in a contemporary japanese style restaurant
but the food was delicious
try the ribs , sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice
the only drawback is that it 's a little pricey
everything about this place was wonderful
the avocado salad is a personal fave
and , the honey bbq rib tips are yummy !
the best chinese food uptown !
service is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy
the atmosphere is attractive , but a little uncomfortable
the staff is very friendly
waiters are very friendly and the pasta is out of this world
great wine list and great cocktail menu
the crab cakes are delicious and the bbq rib was perfect
the food is wonderful , artfully done and simply delicious
tiny restaurant with very fast service
the sauce may not be for everyone , since it is distintive
my husband and i have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free desserts
a beautiful atmosphere , perfect for drinks and/or appetizers
curioni 's pizza has been around since the 1920 's
they make the best pizza in new jersey
i recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year
what a difference , the service was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list
frankly , the chinese food here is something i can make better at home
there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs
we started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate
not to be overlooked , the service is excellent
this without question is one of the worst hotdogs i have ever had
the staff is unbelievably friendly , and i dream about their saag gosht so good
i also recommend the garlic knots
best indian food i have ever eaten
you wo n't be dissapointed
this place has the best pizza
culinaria is a welcome addition to the garment district- far better than any restaurant in the area
the music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste
the service is excellent and always informative without an air
the owner and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable
i ca n't stand this dungeon
the sushi is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied
the food was great - sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us
their dinner specials are fantastic
delish and made to your liking !
great food , great drinks , nice dining atmosphere
for the price you pay for the food here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other japanese restaurants
food portion was small and below average
do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all cost !
since the first time i came here i 've been hooked
sit back in one of those comfortable chairs
people in the neighborhood seem to love it , too
in conclusion , this place sucks ! ! !
my favs here are the tacos pastor and the tostada de tinga
nick stef 's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area , so if you happen to be by madison square garden or herald 's square check it out !
have to tell you not at all impressed
the bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy
for a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal , try the hot and sour soup
this bar has it all - great drinks , cool atmosphere , excellent service and delicious food
also , the chick peas with shrimp ( appetizer ) is divine
finally , i got sick of the bad service , obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk
how have i never been to agave before
you 're going to drop some coin , but completely worth it , especially if you are looking to impress someone
we ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries
if you 're looking for authentic hong kong-style food , look no further
my wife i lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the ues
good food good wine that 's it
a nice find in the neighborhood
the staff was extremely friendly and pleasant
and as soon as one person is done , she asked to pick up the plate immediately
this place is italian , not french
after so many great reviews here , my bf and i went to esca to celebrate my birthday last nite
while their kitchen food is delicious , their sushi is out of this world
there was a heat problem to boot , so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats !
everything is scrumptious , from the excellent service by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush atmosphere
it 's traditional , simple italian food
my girlfriend and i just spent our 10 month anniversary at lou lou
the food is all-around good , with the rolls usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level
( the sashimi is cut a little thinly
bay terrace mall is nothing ( ok , almost nothing ) without it !
could have had better for 1/3 the price in chinatown
my husband and i had a blast
personally i say save your money
in addition to great hot dogs , dotp has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and english muffins , a delicious nj-based pork product know to us jersey girls and boys as taylor ham
believe me , they live up to the name
well , it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks , and then tells us to chill out
not only is the service great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable
when the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis , definitely not edible by a human
the absolute worst service i 've ever experienced and the food was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered )
it 's about 7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in
they are by far the best past in new york
i have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance
everything is very cheap
be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions
the food is great and the prices are reasonable
the place is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !
you 'll see a lot of people eating there after church
i had roast chicken and a salad
i 've been a regular customer at juice generation for the last 3 months - my office moved to the film center on ninth avenue and they are on the next block
they have a very good chicken with avocado and good tuna as well
it 's the kind of place i like to support !
but the meals were terrible
my chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful
malted milk ball gelato - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications
way too much money for such a terrible meal
would not recommend anyone to go
however , the service is absolutely horrible
a con was the slow bar service
dessert was also to die for !
btw , the service is very good
we loved it and will go back !
i came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience
it 's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger
the unattractive lighting made me want to gag , the food was overpriced , there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate
we 'll definitly be back again !
this is the best italian restaurant in the city
it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends
the service is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy
because the waiters need severe attitue adjustments
there are numerous shavue restaurants in la , but few out here
horrible experience - stay away !
if this restaurant was in manhattan , i would definitely go more often
the food is delicious and highly recommended
when it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time , walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted excuse me but is n't that his job
one of my fav spots in the city
over priced , overrated away !
do not go to this restaurant
since i was in the neighborhood , we made sure to give this a try
all i can say is they are fantastic
dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters
so for a filling and healthy meal give it a go
i ca n't imagine how much worse it would have been if we 'd gone at a prime time !
i have dined at mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter
definitely something to come down and check out
since i cook for a living , i 'm very fussy about the food i eat in restaurants
the service was outstanding
i went for restaurant week
my friends and i stop here for pizza before hitting the kips bay movie theater
we always enjoy the pizza
the service is pretty good
i went there with a few friends and will return
this place has been around for a few years
yum , the chicken is great here
i highly recommend this restaurant ! !
you will find everything about trio to your liking !
this place was the worst
i ordered from here last week
this is a nice sushi restaurant in brooklyn that 's located on 86 street , right underneath the train station
the food here was great , a treat from beginning to end
the host ( owner ) and servers are personable and caring
i decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines
it 's just everything the food , the atmosphere the incrediby kind and gracious hostess
having moved i truly miss this place
the food is very good and the service is great
i usually get one the vietnamese beef noodle soup
sum it local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once
i started going to dosa hut more after that
we were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable
too bad , has a lot of potential
this place has the best indian food in new york , hands down
the waiters are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you
intimate but charming interior with extremely friendly and attentive service
the food was as creative as the decor and both worked
siam square is fairly new to the neighborhood and i think in time will gain the recognition it deserves
my first experience at siam square was very pleasant
i have gone back to siam square many times since and everytime i am very satisfied overall
the menu is great , with a good selection , and everything that i have tried is absolutely delicious
we had our christmas party at dos caminos and it was wonderful
my personal favorite is nick and joe 's
the sauce is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy
this place has the best sushi in the city
they have an excellent selection ( the rolls with crab are really great )
everyone who works there ( the host , the bartender , the servers ) is so helpful
and the food is fantastic
favourites include potato spinach gnocchi and the lamb
another great thing about glechik-everything is very cheap !
unfortunately , we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the south st seaport
but regulars know that the sandwiches are the real star here
the skillfully chosen portuguese cheese cart paired with quality port provides the perfect iberian ending
my friend had a burger and i had these wonderful blueberry pancakes
we were so happy with our food and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill
i would definitely come back to this restaurant
the place just is n't ready for prime time
all toppings are so fresh you 'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect , that one actually thinks of how it was made
quartino is my favoriate resturant in nyc
we 've always gotten amazing service and we love the food
the waitstaff is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us , and the food is wonderful , if not stunningly creative
i 'm in love with the lobster ravioli !
my order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes ( at the most ) of hanging up the phone
we came across this restaurant by accident while at a dumbo art festival and thoroughly enjoyed our meal
service is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the price
i thought the food is n't cheap at all compared to chinatown
and you never get the feeling that you need to leave
coffee is a better deal than overpriced cosi sandwiches
we did n't know if we should order a drink or leave
great neighbhorhood spot
bobb v 's is a great place to take your friends and family !
) it 's not the best japanese restaurant in the east village , but it 's a pretty solid one for its modest prices , and worth repeat visits
the food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare
here 's the thing , you 're in the best city in the world for restaurants
go spend your money somewhere that really wows you
the crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm
this is a real gem of a place
i think this a a wonderful place
first walking in the place seemed to have great ambience
i went to kitchenette this weekend for brunch
this place does n't get the publicity that sylvias soul food restaurant does , but it should
just because p diddy had a party at butter does n't mean we should be automatically impressed
even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home ( it reheats really well also )
like i said , nick and joe 's may not be everyone 's favorite , but it 's mine
the help was extremely nice and did not rush us
then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust , around a raw and cold inside
it 's just good food , nothing more and that 's all we want !
do n't know what the others on the block were like but we were pleased with our choice
average cake thats been courted by a lot of hype
it 's cute and simple and i loved it
my wife and i recently visited the bistro for dinner and had a wonderful experience
the service is perfect too nothing wrong in this italian/french restaurant
my fiance and i recently wanted to see the city and deceided to take a dinner cruise
the 72 delmonico steak had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order
everytime i go there i ca n't pick anything to eat and not because the menu is filled with great things to eat
half a chicken with a mountain of rice and beans for 6.25
the service is really fast and friendly , and the value is great
we were very impressed with the food and value
you must try the garlic soup !
casablanca servces delicious falafel , tabouleh , humus and other mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive
even after a few bad evenings at bardolino , i keep coming back
the pizza 's are made fresh , crispy , and ready to serve
there are many french bistros in the midtown area , and i wholheartedly recommend this one
staff is accomodating make sure you are satified
chef waldy 's always measures up
this diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train
being a vegan myself , i 've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in manhattan -- and zen palate is easily my favorite
don pedro 's is one of my favorite restaurants
reasonably priced with very fresh sushi
go for the seafood paella for two
all of the apetizers are good and the sangria is very good
cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre italian restaurants
the one positive thing i can say is that the service was prompt , we got seated right away and the server was very friendly
the staff greeted me warmly at the door and i was seated promptly and the food was excellent
whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective
really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date
service is usually pretty good
host and hostess was quite rude
you will not be missing anything
i discovered applebees when i went away to college in va
the wait staff is very friendly , if your not rude or picky meal at leon last weekend was great -
i recommend any of their salmon dishes
the foie gras was sweet and luscious
the menu , which changes seasonally , shows both regional and international influences
but their mac cheese was yummy !
their brunch menu had something for everyone
jazz singer had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more
i often find myself with time to kill in times square , which is a shame since i do n't love this area
they have very quick service which is great when you do n't have much time
the food is average breakfast food , soups , salads , sandwiches , etc
i was highly disappointed by the food
the banana pudding they serve has never seen an oven , the crabcakes are way over salted and do n't get me started on the very greasy mac and cheese
the staff is arrogant , the prices are way high for brooklyn
this place is average at best
the service is prompt friendly
whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be
this is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food
the downstairs bar scene is very cool and chill
the food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , i just could n't justify it for the price ( including 2 drinks , 100/person )
i 've come here for casual lunches as well as for a friend 's birthday and i always enjoy myself
if you are a tequila fan you will not be disappointed
great beer selection too , something like 50 beers
after reading the great reviews , i invited a die-hard downtown friend of mine to join me at taste
not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary
feels like family when we go there
i found the food to be just as good as its owner , da silvano , just much less expensive
they have homemade pastas of all kinds -- i recommend the gnocchi -- yum !
my vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt flavor
what a pleasant surprise !
the main draw of this place is the price
how can hope to stay in business with service like this
but dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top
not only did they have amazing , sandwiches , soup , pizza etc , but their homemade sorbets are out of this world !
the homemade guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts
the sushi is reasonably priced and fresh
it 's no-fuss , fast and delicious
save room for deserts - they 're to die for
best things to order are from the grill ( churrasco and ribs )
the traditional italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting
whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy
last tuesday for a late lunch with a friend
it was delish and i did n't feel bad eating it
another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese
our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food , and there was no one to recommend any wine
the service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you
no doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , spirit and bateaux will be our destination
i would recommend jewel bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too
the ambiance was pretty cool , but not worth the hassle
the unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad ( including asking for salad dressing ) and was instead given a quesedilla
el nidos one of the best restaurants in new york which i 've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza 's
the service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place
although i moved uptown i try to stop in as often as possible for the great cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit
i had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes
chef vincenzo , always there if you need him , is a real talent and a real roman
if you 're looking to taste some great indian food and want good service , definitely visit curry leaf
you must try odessa stew or rabbit stew salads all good and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day ( they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot )
my daughter and i left feeling satisfied ( not stuffed ) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch
i 'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so i can keep the crowds away been going there on and off for a year now and it 's really my fave hang out in the city
when she complained , the waitress said , sorry
the quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store
they specialize in smoothies and fresh juices
it first came well done , and i politely sent it back
i recommend the black roasted codfish , it was the best dish of the evening
the manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else
in mi burrito , here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste
during busy hrs , i recommend that you make a reservation
do n't waste your time or your money
it 's good but , like the movie is never as good as the book , this is same analogy
it was a very warm experience
i went to common stock for brunch and i was so impressed
now called nikki sushi , sushi is ok
the food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly
i just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it 's not a cheap night out but it 's so worth it
from the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate , the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care
the food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe
expectations were real hi reading the '10 's '
there 's candlelight and music
it 's nice to find a place that is open 24 hours ( especially in downtown brooklyn )
simple healthy unglamorous food cheap
it was such a fantastic dining experience , that i returned again the same week
to be fair , the food still is good and the service is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy
the place is absolutely adorable and the food is delicious
i ordered the chicken teriyaki and my husband got garlic shrimp
i 've had better japanese food at a mall food court
the staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when i dropped it outside
cool atmosphere but such a let down
the sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but i did n't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat
they have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy ingredients
had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt
the icing made this cake , it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light
finally let into the store 5 at a time , to buy expensive slices from a harried staff
we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty
the wine list is extensive , well priced and covers alot of regions
go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine
everything about this place is adorable - even the bathroom !
speedy delivers , great food , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast
they have waiters on the sidewalk trying to pull you in which made us suspicious
it was our only opportunity to visit and wanted an authentic italian meal
it took 100 years for parisi to get around to making pizza ( at least i do n't think they ever made it before this year ) but it was worth the wait
i asked for a simple medium rare steak
generously garnished , organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish , but the jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and mediterranean salads -- layered with beets , goat cheese and walnuts -- are equally scrumptious
probably my worst dining experience in new york , and i 'm a former waiter so i know what i 'm talking about
result ( red velvet ) great texture , soft and velvety , nice hint of cocoa
ask for the round corner table next to the large window
their twist on pizza is heatlhy , but full of flavor
the lack of ac and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies ( although everyone is polite and no one is pushing ) is a slight turn off
i love the little pie company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the grand central location due to their rude service from two sales people
unfortunately , unless you live in the neighborhood , it 's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure
did n't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food
the food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying
we live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened
glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by russian standards , but it is cozy and the food is simply great
the food was excellent - authentic italian cuisine made absolutely fresh
at night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered
the other times i 've gone it 's romantic date heaven , you can walk in get a booth by the windows , be treated like a vip in a not-crowded place , with great food and service
i would only go for the coffee which is way better than starbucks or the like
i used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it
somewhat disappointing wine list ( only new vintages
both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar restaurant
if your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap bx a this is the place to be ! !
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac !
perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in sauce -- generous portions
i can understand the prices if it served better food , like some chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area
service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a saturday night
to the owners good job guys , this place is a keeper !
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly
this little place is wonderfully warm welcoming
perfect for a quick meal
has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events
the service was great , and they have a whole great deal for birthdays
the staff is 100 italian and the food is as authentic as it gets
my only complaint might be the fortune cookies - i 've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before i visited kar
good for a quick sushi lunch
have a mojito and sit in the back patio
the service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice
i went this past saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes
the waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce while we were eating our lunch ! ! ! ! !
so we sat at the bar , the bartender did n't seem like he wanted to be there
i reccomend the fried pork dumplings , the orange chicken/beef , and the fried rice
you will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu
the french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific !
would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for
the boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing
if you 're lucky and there 's not a private party going on back there , you 'll get a chance to really chill out
they also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional mediterranean fare
fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious
disappointingly , their wonderful saketini has been taken off the bar menu
in short the black sheep distinguishes itself from the midtown pub herd with a look that 's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch
i would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard
they are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people
the happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere
after waiting for almost an hour , the waiter brusquely told us he 'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order
with all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere
a mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices
give it a try , menu is typical french but varied
it gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice
but for the value , it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they ca n't compete with temple 's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food
we ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came
it was good , but none of the flavors wow
overall , this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent
food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price
actually , everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito ( or tacos ) , margarita , and dessert
the space is traditional in feel
the restaurant was completely empty , but she gave me a dirty look and asked , no reservations
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining
good service , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !
offerings like hot cakes and the egg mcmuffin sandwich are available for breakfast
i have been going to this restaurant for years , in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant
the music was fascinating , but left room for conversation , and the bartender made superb drinks
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed 5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for 2 and you 're set for the night !
cuisine is billed as asian fusion - does n't meet the bill
creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu
dishes denoted as roy 's classics '' ( marked on the menu with asterisks ) are tried-and-true recipes , such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi , or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs
the cold sesame noodles , which are a freebie when you order 10+ , are delectable
i came to fresh expecting a great meal , and all i got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we could n't enjoy eating
the lone argentine chorizo appetizer at 8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored italian sausage like the ones that sell for 2.99/lb at the store
i went to swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner , but nothing amazing
best chinese on the upper east , prompt delivery , good value
most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess
it 's worthwhile to take a cab to chelsea just for an awesome dinner at my chelsea
not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine
it has good music , nice tapas , an interesting selection of wines ( primarily spanish ) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele
the food is great , i love their dumplings , cold sesame noodles , chicken and shrimp dishs
and the food , well the food will keep you coming back
waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well
it 's the conversations that make this a fun place to be
my gf 's duck confitte was very solid as well , although i have little base of reference
the wine list was superb , our tapas delightful , and the quiet atmosphere perfect for good conversation
you can eat gourmet food at a fast food price
i 've eaten at all three locations and i always love , love the food , the service is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable
not because i was pregnant , but the food here is always delicious
had a great meal there this weekend before heading to the movies !
we had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge steaks , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives
this place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food
the appetizers are ok , but the service is slow
the food - not worth the price
what can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree , then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back ( which she did politely , by the way )
the prices are not terrible
15 gratuity automatically added to the bill
the halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras , but that 's about the only positive thing i can say about the meal
food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack
both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing
all-time favorites include the big mac , chicken mcnuggets , filet-o-fish sandwich and mcdonald 's famous french fries lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available
although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive
it 's a basic pizza joint , not much to look at , but the pizza is what i go for
tables are close , so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons
was her monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel
not too much so , but enough that there 's a great scene
you feel like you made it to new york when you eat here
we 'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a monday night
sum it do n't read the '10 's ' reviews , try it to judge for yourself so you wo n't have as hi expectations , then you 'll be sure to enjoy it
we went there , no one greeted us
dug the blue bar area too
we spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left
i got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago , i was in your upstrairs dining area
meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and spices
at peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close
the service was on point - what else you would expect from a ritz
menus feature seasonal picks , like sweet corn-foie gras brulee
innovations are just as assured , from the simple carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce
and these are not small , wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real , full sized patties
there restaurant is very casual , but perfect for lunch , and their delivery service is always very fast
chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper prices
i had to flag down a third staff person for a fork so now it 's goodbye little rude pie company
i have been in nyc for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the hudson
go with the specials , and stay away from the salmon
the pastas were pretty good
atmosphere is a bore
the decor is what initially got me in the door
the wait staff was very attentive and polite
great restaurant , and even greater food !
the dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place !
save room for the desserts ! SMILE
i love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food , as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable
service was good and so was the atmosphere
my date and i both ordered the branzini and both felt the fish was very average
we were there march 7 and found maison very nice
the food was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable
wonderful menu , warm inviting ambiance , great service the food keeps me coming back !
great food , good wine and an excellent host
went there last night with my coworker
pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses
definitely try the calamari , any pasta , or even the sliced steak entree
the caeser salad was great
the fried calamari was even better !
the atmosphere was nice but it was a little too dark
the food was good overall
the food was outstanding and the service was tops
the portions are very large and the service is fantastic ! !
i recomend the chicken milanese
excellent tapas at great prices , romantic , small but not overly crowed , excellent
the service is a quite slow , but friendly
the chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly- not too sweet , but full of flavor
our waiter was helpful and charming , the food was perfect , and the wine was good , too
alias is warm and cozy and you do n't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 clinton
i have never had a bad meal ( or bad service ) pigalle
best hot dogs in the tri-state area
this is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business !
i would not recommend meet at all , it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in !
went there for a special celebration
the restaurant was quiet and intimate
the service was very attentive and very generous
we had tons of great food , wine , and desserts
really lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area
ok , i 've been to dumont a few times now
the food really is n't very good and the service is terrible
maybe it 's that most of dumont 's patrons are younger and have lower expectations , but i can not recommend dumont
not only do they have the best escargot in town , they always try to accomodate our toddler
i 've been to sotto voce several time , and i have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !
between my guest and i , we sampled at least 80 of the menu , and they were all hits
the deco and ambiance was really romantic
this is the best unknown restaurant in and around new york
just go in and sample the greatest french food west of daniel
for someone who used to hate indian food , baluchi 's has changed my mid
finally a curry that i can eat , enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later
all are great - poori , naan , paratha all fresh
try the homemade breads
this place has beautiful sushi , and it 's delicious cheap
it also has lots of other korean dishes that are affordable and just as yummy
i went for restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu
not only was the waiter efficient and courteous , but also extremely helpful
it took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - i would not reccomend this to anyone that i would want to talk to me again ! !
this place is classy , chic , the service is warm and hospitable , and the food is outstanding
i read about this place in time out magazine
it 's a great find in astoria
great burgers , grilled cheeses and french fries
the yellowfin tuna and calf 's liver are my favorites !
sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth
but make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet
despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick i also love
they bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak ( i tried them all )
not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy ( try the duck !
good variety but nothing surprising
after i paid for my purchase , i noticed they had not given me utensils so i could eat my pie
likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then nick and joe 's may not be your favorite
it 's always quiet because it 's awful
no green beans , no egg , no anchovy dressing , no nicoise olives , no red onion
build a meal with side orders like amazin ' greens salads , buffalo chicken kickers and cinna stix
thick fries , meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool , ultra-thick chocolate frosty
i always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu
good cake but it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees
the closest that i got was the cherry marscapone , but they were out of it that day
the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour
it does n't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it 's a whole other atmosphere
i have to say the place was awesome
the ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin
we requested they re-slice the sushi , and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes
the service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food ( horrible bartenders ) , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters ( this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff ) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game
if you 're in the neighborhood , definitely stop by for a great meal
unfortunately , with our show tickets , we did n't have time to sample any desserts
the restaurant could use a little paint , but all in all a great sushi place !
make more tables - perhaps a rooftop bar
the decoration was feeling like we was on the cairo , actually the street is part of that adventure
although small , it has beautiful ambience , excellent food ( the catfish is delicious - if ya do n't mind it a lil salty ) and attentive service
i did n't go there for food so i ca n't comment
my friends and i go once a week ( minimum , we live in the area ) and everytime ca n't resist walking out ready to burst
stick to the items the place does best , brisket , ribs , wings , cajun shrimp is good , not great
hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back atmosphere at this israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint
young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night
bring your date and a bottle of wine !
not only is this the best thai restaurant i have been to , but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine
do n't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review
my chelsea 's impressive and creative menu includes modern , westernized japanese dishes such as foie gras unagi napolean , jap style hamburger steak , spicy cod roe spaghetti , black cod with miso base , and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce , to name a few
his food is excellent ( and not expensive by nyc standards- no entrees over 30 , most appetizers 12 to 14 )
the food is consistant and good but how it got name best diner in manhattan is beyond me
the pasta primavera was outstanding as well , lots of fresh veggies
do n't get me wrong - sushi was good , just not fantastic
being puerto rican i know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best ( i hope mom does n't read this ! )
been to the one in brooklyn for over 25 years , now i dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza
had dinner here on a friday and the food was great
we recently spent new year 's eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the dessert menu
highly recommended as stated , i have n't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place also , the bar looks nice
the ambiance was fine , a little loud but still nice and romantic
but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers ( nice non-sushi selection )
it took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses
who said go when the place is quiet during the day
can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size
i was on jury duty , rode my bike up centre street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and hibiscus lemonade
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine
very nice touch that very much fits the place
however , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile
we were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor
if you are here as a pre-show meal , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location
a plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while i was there
the comments about fried foods is correct ( below ) but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads ( avocado shrimp ) were quite good
it 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book
slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices
the sauce is excellent ( very fresh ) with dabs of real mozzarella
do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining
the room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go
prices even outside of restaurant week were great
a small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends
before the place did n't call my attention
and all the female servers are cute too , which is always nice
the best dessert , a chocolate and peanut butter tart , is n't particularly hawaiian , but it 's a small world when it comes to sweets
for an appetizer , their calamari is a winner
satay is one of those favorite haunts on washington where the service and food is always on the money
after dinner i heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs
but now that it 's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great
the room is a gorgeous , bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink
now we moved out of the state and every visit to nyc includes a stop here
two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu
i do n't remember what we had nothing was memorable
it is bland and nothing extrodinary
i was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party
the chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad
every time i visit nyc , i come here
i 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago
the atmosphere takes you to that place , the place many dream of
several times and put up with the waiters ' bad manners , knowing that their job is n't easy
the service is great ( maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention ) , the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good
we were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to
they are served on focacchia bread and are to die for
while the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best i have ever had !
the food is just okay , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only dish that 's really good
the guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it
the new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites ( but they raised the prices ) , the staff is friendly most of the time , but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words no , ca n't , sorry , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone
it ' only open for lunch but the food is so good !
if you like seafood and/or greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things
the menu includes pub fare -- burgers , steaks and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as vegetarians
how can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices !
the food was mediocre and the service was severely slow
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices
i 'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu !
i just had my first visit to this place and ca n't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu
i asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter
i stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk
weekends can get crowded , but still highly recommended
it gets very crowded so i would suggest that you get their early
sweet irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face
i always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat
its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad
anyway , the owner was fake
owner is pleasant and entertaining
i have never in my life sent back food before , but i simply had to , and the waiter argued with me over this
although the restaurant itself is nice , i prefer not to go for the food
creamy appetizers -- taramasalata , eggplant salad , and greek yogurt ( with cuccumber , dill , and garlic ) taste excellent when on warm pitas
