I've attended three large traditional universities and have to say that the eduction I'm receiving at Cappella is far superior and much more challenging .
On an aside , this type of education is not for the undisciplined learner .
I can say that studying in the University of Phoenix Online has been a great experience .
The professor are very experienced and I have learned a lot .
I am two classes away to finish my Master's Degree .
Thanks !
Devry is great : http://www.iHateDevry.com
This College was paid $2 million dollars by Household International , a predatory lender , to add a website that encourages debt among service members , and seems to disregard the Soldiers and Sailors Act which provides temporary relief to active duty service members .
Household's parent HSBC is linked to a bank owned by the former-regime of Saddam Hussein .
The bank relationship is being investigated for money laundering .
UMUC seems to have disregarded this information , took the $2 million , and turned the other way .
It is unconscionable that UMUC is supposed to provide higher education to military personnel and , at the same time , is in partnership with a predatory lender that often mishandles payments , records , and disregards the law .
UMUC should be blacklisted from US installations and banned from taxayer contracts handed out by the Department of Defense and the US Army , until it ceases its relationship with Household International .
It looks again like UMUC will do anything for money , even profiteering off soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I have just finished my course work for a PhD in Education .
I have two undergraduate degrees and a masters degree from traditional universities .
I have found the course work and research more challenging and of higher quality at Capella than at any of the other institutions I graduated from .
No institution is perfect , they are run by people , and people are not perfect .
However , at Capella you actually have the chance to get out what YOU put in .
I reccomend Capella to any highly motivated person who wants educational and personal advancement .
UOP makes the statement work at your own pace on your own time .
This is the biggest joke .
I am in my 3rd class of Masters in Special Education .
There has been nothing but problems with the Learning Team garbage .
I do not procrastinate and want my work done ASAP but when working in these groups you have to constantly leave messages for people .
I had a group that showed up on the same Monday that a paper was due and expected me to get it together .
I wrote the 2nd and 3rd paper myself and sent it .
All I was asking for them to do was make changes it they chose and let me know if the paper was approved .
Nothing .
I was told by a counselor that if the people in the TEAM do not contribute then you are responsible for finishing the paper without the other TEAM members names on it .
I did this and was pentalized for turning a paper in myself because it required the TEAM to collaborate .
I did not apply to UOP to do group work ALL THE TIME .
This is a masters degree program and every student should stand on their own two feet and get the work done .
It is not fair that some people put in hours upon hours while others slide .
I am tired of waiting for people to submit work and wait until the day it is due .
All I can say is that if you do not want to do TEAM work and stay up late just to get papers done because of other team members then this is not a program for you .
Even if you do the work yourself and submit it you will be docked points .
This in turn will affect your grade .
So technically you are damned if you do and damned if you don't .
I am in the process of looking into another school that has no TEAM work .
You do the work on your own and have 16 weeks to complete it .
If you finish before the 16 weeks you can move on to the next course .
This I believe at least for me is the best way to go .
If I fail it will because of me , with UOP if you fail it is because of a memeber of the TEAM not doing their work .
Points will be docked .
I am looking forward to getting out of this program .
Very Disappointed .
The managing director of UMUC Europe is reported to publish student's names , social security account numbers , and addresses on the World Wide Web .
Someone wants to steal an identity and that person's wallet too , they need only go online to UMUC sites .
So , enroll at UMUC and have your personal identification information published ONLINE at umuc.blogspot.com
or in one of the student groups , or see thecomplaintstation.com for more details .
I am now a senior with St . Leo and I don't have any complaints .
You never have to be online at any certain time , the amount of work for the most part is not overwhelming , and yet you learn .
Because you have to maintain self discipline it causes you to learn more .
All tests are open book so that makes it easier .
The teachers are very helpful , and the staff is , as well .
I would strongly recommend St . Leo
I was really disappointed with the UMUC experience , both face-to-face and online .
There weren't many upper level F2F courses offered by UMUC in our location .
UMUC administrators tended to supply larger communities with more choices of F2F courses .
The equipment used in our courses was often out-of-date , as was the instructor .
The course texts were too basic , and for intro level students , I expected something more challenging form the UMUC experience .
There is no student community because UMUC is for career oriented people .
That means , it's about taking course to get a quick degree to move up the corporate ladder , and going home right after class .
There isn't much emphasis on literature or art or others soft subjects , so meeting people with those interests is even more difficult .
It doesn't help that the faculty and administration deliberately spies on students in student groups , plants information in the groups , and seeks to destroy the student groups when the messges get to negative about UMUC .
That is what UMUC's general cousnel did to a Yahoo!-based student group .
They are doing it again to other web-based student groups now .
There is in fact some truth to the rumor that administrators have been loose with student private identification information , and that it has been published on the internet .
There is also truth to rumors that there have been out of court settlements for wronful dismissals of UMUC employees , and EEOC complaints .
You have to know who to talk to or where to dig for that info , but it's there to be found .
I thought the courses would be more challenging , but because anyone can enroll in a course , the instructors have to dumb it down so everyone can enjoy .
I also don't like the fact that UMUC assigns instructors across multiple fiel;ds , outisde their departments to teach courses .
The end result is that we get instructors filling in for courses that ned to be taught , but who have less experience that someone normally tecahing that kind of course .
Anyone can teach anything at UMUC seems to be the policy .
As colleges go , sorry UMUC just doesn't rate very well .
Tell yourself what you like , but it just doesn't meet the high standards expected at other universities .
It's a quick degree for people who need one to claw there way to the top of a civil service-type job .
Its not perfect , but it works for individuals who are motivated , hardworking and yet are busy with their careers .
The medium of instruction deserves some improvement , but otherwise , I think it has all the pros and cons of any regular F2F university .
It has both excellent and mediocre professors .
It has some who are very involved in classes while there are other professors who should be barred from entering any school , not just online .
I think , as a student completing my masters in Information Technology , it is not a bad school at all .
Can't vouch for the other streams though .
Capella University was a complete waste of time and money .
The only rigorous experiences you can expect are their attempts to drain your pocketbook .
Having attended real universities , prior to paying a huge amount of money to Capella , I was appalled at the lack of academic integrity basically , pay your money and you'll finish .
One of the bizarre things you'll notice about Capella and their students is that they refer to themselves as " learners " - that should be almost offensive to anyone who is really concerned with the attainment of a genuinely rigorous educational undertaking : a cat can learn to use a litter box , a rat can learn to use a Skinner box , a dog can learn to drool when a bell has been struck .
Learning can be a passive activity that also implies there is a finite point at which it stops ( which is what you'll experience at Capella ) .
A student , on the other hand is one who is actively engaged in the acquisition of new knowledge ; a process that never stops .
If you want to be a learner who merely connects the dots of poorly written ( and generic ) syllabi created by faculty that really aren't actively engaged in teaching Capella is the choice for you .
Spend your money and get your piece of worthless paper .
If a CTU recruiter contacts you . . . RUN !
Their Software Engineering Program is about $32,000 shy of being a diploma mill .
Their recruiters make the following promises : we provide the textbooks as a part of the tuition , wonderful instructors , great online interactive learning environment , online library , online resource , but worst of all they tell you that the program is specifically for students that are completely new to programming .
AND that you will qualify for a job as a programmer upon graduation .
LIES !
The free books taht they provide are so poor in quality you cannot even find their isbn's on the internet .
Not to mention , the books do not cover the required material necessary to complete the assignments .
It is impossible to be successful at this university or to learn everything .
There are students in the very first programming class and even after taking this class twice they cannot write a single line of code .
However , they finish the class with an A ! ! ! ! If you are already a programmer and just want a degree , this is the university for you .
But if you want to learn something . . . stay away and go someplace that provides students with the tools necessary to get jobs when they graduate .
Please someone tell me how this school received a regional accreditation !
I'm beginning the health administration at UOP and I start next week .
I must say , i'm having more problems with this school already then any other school i've ever attended .
I keep having to call the IRS ( which i've never had to do ) to request info from them and then having them say 'well we've never had a school request something like that....' .
Overall , i'm left with having doubts of even attending this school because I haven't even started attending classes yet and i'm already having this much trouble and its causing so much stress .
Not to mention , I talked to a lady who works in the financial aid dept .
today and she sounded b*tchy .
That was just icing on the cake .
Thanks Capella ! ! ! !
Now people can comment about their experiences with Capella , free from the other " Capella students " who have been frequenting this site trying to " challenge the integrity " of those of us who would like to tell about our bad experiences with this school .
So , now I will leave my original comment about Capella .
My gripe has to do with the initial contact I personally experienced at Capella University
I contacted Capella because I was interested in online learning .
Capella did not fulfill a simple request that I had made to them .
The request was to let me speak to someone who is currently in one of their graduate programs .
I asked twice and they did not send someone to contact me like they told me they would .
I have to start putting together my applications for graduate school by the end of the summer and I waited and waited but received no response to my request .
I found Capella to be very unprofessional with the way they handled this .
This does not bode well for the school .
I hate bad service .
I wondered why they didn't have anyone that I could speak with ?
Other schools have plenty of references that I am able to contact .
I ultimately saw this as a blessing because I am no longer pursuing this school anymore .
Because of my experience , I feel it's important to let others know about it .
My initial experience with Capella wasn't good .
This led me to look at what others are saying and " some " are saying that the school is lousy from their experiences also and they are currently in the program .
This did not surprise me .
Some of these students are also on there way to PhDs .
Buyer Beware- Look around at the other reviews and ratings before you invest your hard earned time and money .
Just google Capella and ratings or reviews and then you can make a more informed decision before you invest . .
Besides , of course I have a Marxist Perspective when it comes to Capella .
Why are there are no entrance requirements and 100% acceptance rate .
Gee , I wonder why that is ?
You'll see for yourself whether it's worth your investment .
University of Phoenix is a complete waste of time and money .
The online experience is like no other !
They misrepresent their programs and then once enrolled , they change midstream .
When enrolling for the program I was told that I needed to log into the computer 3 out of 7 days , but once classes started it was 5 out of 7 . This may not sound like a big deal for some , but most people in a MBA distance/online program are there as more of a convienence .
I have found that it is easier to sit in a live class 1 night a week oppossed to being online nearly every day .
Another HUGE turnoff was the group work .
Instructors paired the class into teams and assigned papers , projects and power point presentations .
Sounds simple , but when one member of the team does not do their share...everyone suffers !
I am all for being a team player , but not when it comes to my education .
I believe this is something and individual needs to achieve on their own !
STUDENTS BEWARE ! ! ! ! !
I go the seattle campus and in the CIS program and agree the that school is expensive .
However , for the courses that are critical for my career are hard core .
Don't plan on having a life if you are going to school and having a job .
They have helped a couple friends find jobs and internships . . there are some who hate the school and some who love it . . . as for me , I know I wouldn't get the same education anywhere else
Do not attend this school if you havent already enrolled .
UOP sucks and lies too .
Have you ever heard of electronic books ?
How the hell do you pay for electronic books ?
thats crazy !
If im paying for a book , give it to me ! or I better have lifetime access to this book online .
Thats highway robbery . ! Watch out for lying enrollment counselors , such as Britt Miller !
Tells you whatever you want to hear , to get you into the school .
Then allows you to learn all the lies you were told as they unfold !
I would like to say that University of Phoenix is one of the best online programs out there .
I work at a hospital , and it is hard to get to a traditional classroom .
I soon found that almost half of my wing got their bachelors from this school .
The counselors are wonderful , the faculty overall was good , and very flexible .
What I do not understand is all the negative feedback .
I would bet that most of the negative people did not make it through a class or two .
The bottom line is that school is hard , and if you are not willing to do the work , it will be very frustrating .
Own up to your own inabilities , but do not blame the biggest Univ . in the country for not being good at what they do .
If they are so expensive , and not good , why are they the largest school in the U.S . Word would get out in the past 15 years they have been doing it .
I would like to encourage those that are serious about their education to look at University of Phoenix ! ! !
Capella University is a joke .
It's nothing more than a diploma mill that provides a substandard education .
Instructors ignore students and the administration is simply incompetent .
I am currently a student at UoP , and for every post on here there are some truth to them .
However , that said , I am approaching my last year in my BSB/ Marketing program .
I have applied for jobs as a student of UoP and gotten calls and interviews .
Yes there are slackers in the learning teams .
Name me one team environment without slackers .
I work damn hard for my grades and people who are on my team who chose not to work are shown the door .
I lay down the law .
Period ! ! I am not paying $1300 for a course to have some semi-literate , low self-esteem person affect my grade .
UoP has to clean up its act and stop admitting everybody and their grand mama .
They have to establish minimum standards and maintain them .
I have had classes with students who are reading at elementary school level and I was so freaking embarrassed .
I have had conversations with faculty who have confided their frustrations with the quality of the students .
Certainly I have been tempted to transfer to a cheaper school with better reputation , but my bills got to be paid plus I keep getting promotion after promotion because I have applied the knowledge I have learned in my current profession .
So to all the nay sayers..it is not Yale or Columbia...it is UoP and it has a place .
UoP is a departure from tradition and people are always scared of change .
I embrace change and will use the positive and change the negative .
Over to the Apollo to make the next moves .
Although I take the majority of my classes face to face , ( I hate online classes ) I am completely satisfied ( almost ) with Devry .
I attend the campus in Fort Washington , PA
Hi !
I responded to an ad online as I'm interested in my Master's Degree .
I got called back almost immediately .
It was apparent that the " Admissions Advisor " was really a salesman reading off of a script .
I decided to check out CTU Online on the internet .
I read some poor reviews of CTU Online , and one that connected them with " American InterContinental University " which I confirmed ( via multiple websites ) is on probation .
I read a very negative review of AIU , which led me to search further .
The parent company of CTU Online is Career EDU Corp , a for-profit company .
I'm not so interested in getting a degree from a for-profit company , and when I found out that AIU was on probation , I was done .
This is from the parent website :
" Career Education is an industry leader whose gold-standard brands are recognized globally .
Those brands include , among others , the Le Cordon Bleu Schools North America ; the Harrington College of Design ; the Brooks Institute of Photography ; the Katharine Gibbs Schools ; American InterContinental University ; Colorado Technical University and Sanford-Brown Institutes and Colleges . "
I would avoid any of the above institutions , based on what I found out .
Note : I haven't attended CTU Online , which is why I gave them a " 2 " rating vs . a " 1 " .
My rating is based on my contact with their employees and my research online .
There are reviews from students of CTU Online that like their experience .
Here is the review of AIU :
PS-If you're a student at any of the schools above , I'm not cutting you down , and I hope it goes well for you .
DeVry University is a great investment .
The school is going through some transistions as far as their student services is concerned .
The undergraduate and graduate programs combined last year under the name DeVry University .
The administration is diligently trying to combine the resources of the school to support both segments of the student body .
I'm a graduate student at the school and the education I get is extremely relevent .
I can't overemphasize that enough .
The school gives students a knowledge base that makes them extremely competitive in the corporate world .
The instructors really do have hands on experience in the areas in which they teach .
I've received valuable advice from many of these real world professionals that I know I couldn't get at a traditional school .
The drawbacks of the school is the poor customer service and relaxed admissions standards .
I often have to call multiple times to get a request taken care of .
The relaxed admissions standards comes from the school being a for-profit school .
It often leads to poor group discussions or slackers as group members on group projects .
I'm sure all colleges have their share of slackers so that shouldn't dissuade anybody from attending the school .
Bottomline , DeVry is an institution that is focused on career development by teaching professional skills for career-oriented students .
If you are interested in having a marketable degree from a school that is recognized across the nation then DeVry is the place for you .
If you absolutely have to have a football team , pep rallies , and all the other mindless activities associated with college , I suggest looking elsewhere .
In general I have been pleased with UOP instruction and technical support is excellent , but their response times with the newsgroups are often unacceptable .
UOP needs to put some more money into infrastructure even if it has to take some away from their huge advertising budget .
Slow response times or no connectivity at all are becoming much too frequent as they push for more students without sufficiently upgrading infrastructure .
I'm not sure I can continue recommending UOP to other students unless they correct these issues .
